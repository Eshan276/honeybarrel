The Old Grand-Dad line is in honor of the iconic Meredith Basil Hayden, Sr., commonly referred to as Basil Hayden. He was born on Wednesday January 2, 1743 in St. Mary\u2019s, Maryland to George Hayden, Sr. (1715-July 10, 1754) and Charity Mary Morgan (1718- October 3, 1791). Basil\u2019s family immigrated to the United States from England in the 1660\u2019s, fleeing the religious intolerance for Catholics at that time in their country. In their effort to find refuge, his ancestors found home in St. Mary\u2019s, Maryland which later became the birthplace of Basil himself. He married Henrietta Cole (born July 2, 1754) in 1771 and together they had fifteen children. Nearly a century after the great emigration, in 1785 Basil continued in the faith of his ancestors by leading a congregation of Catholics through the tough journey of hundreds of rugged miles from Maryland to Nelson County, Kentucky. During the time of this journey, Basil and Henrietta had already given birth to nine of their fifteen children, but unfortunately four of them passed away during the perils of the journey to Kentucky. Once the congregation reached the Kentucky lands, they settled and formed farm lands. Henrietta and Basil went on to birth six more children in the Kentucky settlement. Here Basil began small scale distilling in 1788 and was known for using higher rye content in his mash bill than what was typically being used by other distillers of the time. He continued distilling until his death on Sunday July 15, 1804 in Washington County, Kentucky.",

Taylor was a grand nephew of U.S. President Zachary Taylor. Like various other figures in the Kentucky whiskey industry, Taylor is often referred to in public relations materials as a \"Colonel\", since he held the honorary title of Kentucky Colonel. The honorary title resembles that of the military rank but is not actually associated with military service and has primarily been used for public relations purposes (e.g., by \"Colonel\" Harland Sanders, the founder of Kentucky Fried Chicken). Taylor started and owned seven different distilleries throughout his career, the most successful being the O.F.C. and Carlisle distilleries, the forerunners of today's Buffalo Trace Distillery.",

                "Description": "William Larue Weller was born into a distilling family in Kentucky in 1825  and launched his W.L. Weller brand in 1849. Originally a rectification business (creating 'whiskey' using neutral spirit  colouring and flavourings)  this all changed with the Bottled in Bond Act of 1897 and the death of Weller two years later. The company was left in the hands of the fiercely passionate Julian 'Pappy' Van Winkle I who having steered it safely through the wreckage of National Prohibition  established Old Weller alongside the newly acquired Old Fitzgerald labels and the flagship brands for the new Stitzel-Weller distillery in 1933. It was produced there for over 60 years  eventually being sold to the Sazerac Company in 1999  who distil it at Buffalo Trace using Pappy's recipe to this day. This is a 1978 bottling of the 7 year old Original 107 Proof wheated bourbon. This was produced by United Distillers at Stitzel-Weller  although by this point it had been renamed by its previous owners after flagship brand  Old Fitzgerald. The Stitzel-Weller company was officially established in 1933 at the repeal of National Prohibition in the US. It was the result of a merger between the A. Ph. Stitzel distillery and its biggest customer  W.L. Weller & Sons. The Stitzel-Weller distillery opened on Kentucky Derby day in 1935  and quickly developed a reputation for its high quality wheated bourbon  and its main brands were Old Weller  Old Fitzgerald and Cabin Still. The original ownership was shared between Alex T. Farnsley  Arthur Philip Stitzel and Julian Van Winkle. The former passed-away in 1941 and 1947  respectively  leaving the Van Winkle family as the sole heirs to the business. 'Pappy' died in 1965  having handed the reigns to his son  Julian II the year prior  who ran it until 1972 when the board of directors forced him to sell it to the Norton-Simon subsidiary  Somerset Imports. When they were bought over by the American arm of Scottish distillers  DCL  its subsequent iteration invested heavily in bourbon. So much so in fact  that their newly rebuilt Bernheim distillery had such capacity that Stitzel-Weller was rendered surplus to requirements. It was shut down in 1992. Still part of the Diageo portfolio  it has never re-opened and instead now houses the visitor experience for their Bulleit brand.",

Only 2634 bottles are available worldwide. These distilleries have long been staples of the Compass Box bottlings but never with malt this old. Clynelish accounts for 50.9% of the blend and is a parcel of 24-year-old malt, while the Caol Ila accounts for the other 49.1%, and we are only told it is 'considerably older' (rumored to be a 34-year-old). Along with the beautiful artwork on the bottle (the original artwork was partly produced by Da Vinci), this is another stellar whisky highlighting the elements of both distilleries (waxy, grassy, citrus, earthy, and peaty) in a superb blended malt.\n\n\n",

As soon as you crack that plastic cap, you receive a distinct scent of freshly-picked apples.  After pouring it, the apples continue, but are accompanied by mowed-grass, corn, and a distant mint \u2013 simple but pleasant.  On tasting OF1849 was not as smooth as I\u2019d expexted, exploding onto the tongue.  This develops, however into caramel apples, some oak, popcorn, and tres leches cake.  In other words, this is certainly sweet.  The popcorn which develops in the middle adds an interesting contrast to the rest of the swirl.  There\u2019s also quite a nice mouth-feel to it and a spicy-to-clean finish.",

Rich notes of dried fruits, dark chocolate, and toffee are complemented by hints of maritime brine and a subtle smokiness, reflective of its coastal origins. The palate reveals layers of flavor, including sweet sherry notes, caramelized nuts, and spices, with a gentle peat influence that adds depth without overpowering the other elements.\n\nThe finish is long and warming, characterized by lingering notes of oak, dark fruit, and a touch of sea salt. This well-rounded whisky balances sweetness with savory complexity, making it a favorite among connoisseurs.\n\nSpringbank Campbeltown 18 Year is celebrated not only for its rich flavors but also for its craftsmanship and tradition, making it a must-try for those seeking an authentic taste of Scottish whisky heritage.\n",

This limited edition celebrates their rich cultural heritage   Nose: Very fruity, cherries, pineapple, green apple, cheesecake, oak. Lusciously sweet. Palate: Initially creamy caramel. Then the rich fruits come forward with the caramel playing the supportive role, almost coating the fruits. A bit of smoke wanders throughout. Robust flavors. Finish: The unique Orkney peat comes forward, but a bit more restrained than other HP's. A faint hint of char. At the very end, there's any extremely subtle note of pineapple that the smoke almost covers up. Wish it were a bit longer, but interesting nonetheless.",

Peat was collected from local bogs to smoke the barley and soft peat influenced water from local sources was used in its careful production. This vintage was produced under the watchful eye of Bessie Williamson, historically the first female whisky distiller who would become a pivotal character in Laphroaig\u2019s history. After an incredible four decades of maturation this release was bottled at a natural cask strength of 42.4% Abv in 2001. With aged stocks of this Islay distillery in short supply this is the only time a 40 year old expression has ever been released.",

            "description": "The Four Roses Super Premium bourbon whiskey is an exclusive offering sold only in Japan, distinguished by its elegant bottle with a silver cap and a rose motif on the label. This whiskey is a blend of various Four Roses recipes, with 80% of the bourbon aged a minimum of 8 years and 20% aged 10 years or greater. It is bottled at 86 proof (43% ABV) and is known for its light copper color and a flavor profile that includes floral and sweet notes, vanilla, and a touch of oak. The finish is described as starting light and sweet with honey and vanilla, then transitioning to a drier side with aged oak and leather, along with a dash of white pepper. The Four Roses Super Premium is sometimes referred to as Four Roses \"Platinum\" due to the color of the embossed roses on the bottle, which are made of light metal. This bourbon is a product of the Kirin Brewery Company, which acquired the Four Roses brand trademark from Diageo in February 2002. While it is a Japan-only bourbon, it is bottled at 750ml, unlike many other export-only bourbons, including Four Roses Black Label, which are typically bottled at 700ml. The Four Roses Super Premium is a unique novelty for bourbon enthusiasts and a must-have for diehard Four Roses fans looking to complete their collection.",

Named after the Noe family home in Bardstown, Kentucky, this release pays homage to the rich history and traditions of the Beam family. Aged for 7 years, 2 months, and 22 days, this bourbon is bottled at a potent cask strength of 62.3% ABV (124.6 proof).\n\nThe nose of The Beam House Batch is powerful and inviting, offering a complex array of aromas. Rich notes of caramel, vanilla, and peanut brittle are complemented by hints of dried fruit, particularly caramel apple and raisin. There's also a subtle touch of charred oak and a whisper of br\u00fbl\u00e9ed sugar, creating an enticing bouquet that beckons you to take a sip.\n\nOn the palate, this Booker's release delivers a bold yet surprisingly balanced experience. The high proof is evident but not overwhelming, allowing the rich flavors to shine through. Intense caramel and toffee notes lead the charge, followed by layers of brown butter, vanilla cake, and butterscotch. The signature Beam nuttiness is present but not dominant, harmonizing well with the sweeter elements. As the bourbon develops on the tongue, spice notes of cinnamon, nutmeg, and black pepper emerge, adding depth and complexity to the profile.\n\nThe finish is long and satisfying, with the interplay of sweet and spicy notes lingering pleasantly. Oak tannins provide a gentle dryness that balances the residual sweetness, while hints of leather and tobacco add a sophisticated touch to the conclusion. The Beam House Batch showcases the craftsmanship and heritage of Booker's Bourbon, offering a full-flavored and nuanced drinking experience that will delight bourbon enthusiasts and collectors alike.\n\n",

This bottle was produced by Schenley in the 1970's at George T. Stagg distillery , better known today as Buffalo Trace.  German import.",

After carefully assessing the barrels he vatted and tanked the liquid in 2014 to prevent any further wood interaction. Bottled at 100 proof just a tiny amount, 710 bottles, were produced from this 11 barrel run. A typical barrel should produce north of 270 bottles, so 25 years of maturation has lead to considerable angel's share. Bottled at 100 proof in a Glencairn crystal decanter and presented in a handmade wooden box. This presentation box was crafted with the staves from the 11 barrels in the vatting.",

The deal was completed in 1983, two years before the retirement of George T. Stagg master distiller, Elmer T. Lee, who had served there for 36 years, working his way from the bottom up. One of his final pioneering triumphs before doing so was the introduction of mass produced single barrel bourbon, specifically through the creation of the Blanton's brand in 1984.  Normally a 6 to 8 year old bourbon, it is aged in Warehouse H at Buffalo Trace, which is the only metal-clad warehouse at the distillery, commissioned for construction by Albert B. Blanton, after whom the whiskey is named. The warehouse was built shortly after prohibition and being metal, transfers heat quicker than brick warehouses, allowing for more rapid ageing.  The popularity of these products was particularly high in Japan, coinciding with a market boom for American whiskey there in the 1980s. In 1991, with Age International in some financial trouble, a Japanese company called Takaro Shuzo stepped in and acquired a 22.5% stake in the company. In an unusual series of events, they then scuppered a deal the following year that was to see the remaining shares sold to Heublein (a subsidiary of Grand Metropolitan). Their deal the year before had included a 30 day right of refusal to purchase the shares for themselves should they be put up for sale. With the deal all but done, the Japanese company stepped in on the final day of the window to acquire full control of the company. As it turned out, their only interest was in the brands, and they had used the 30 days to negotiate a deal with the Sazerac Company of  New Orleans. This saw the American company take ownership of the distillery (which they renamed Buffalo Trace in 1999), as well as the exclusive production and US distribution rights for the Age International labels. This is an arrangement that is still in place today.  This is a 2014 bottling, released for the Japanese market in order to commemorate the 30th anniversary of the creation of the Blanton's brand in 1984.   Since 1999, every bottle of Blanton's has one of 8 different stoppers, each depicting a horse and jockey at a different stage of finishing a race. The designs are all lettered so that a complete set laid out side by side will spell \"BLANTONS.\" ",

This expression is the inaugural release in the BLACKENED's Master of Whiskey series, showcasing the talents of BLACKENED Master Distiller & Blender Rob Dietrich and Willett Distillery's Master Distiller Drew Kulsveen. The whiskey is a blend of high rye and low rye mashbills from Willett, aged for an average of 6.5 years, with some barrels as old as 8 years. After aging, the whiskey is finished in Madeira casks for 14 weeks and subjected to BLACKENED's proprietary Black Noise process, which uses low hertz frequencies from Metallica's music to vibrate the barrels, enhancing the interaction between the whiskey and the wood. The result is a whiskey with a deep amber color and a rich, complex flavor profile that includes notes of red raspberries, strawberry, mint, charred oak, brown sugar, and a hint of grape, leading to a finish with rhubarb, fig, plum, and spice. Bottled at 109.6 proof, this whiskey is a testament to the art of collaboration and innovation in the whiskey-making process.",

The group has established itself as a notable player in the private barrel selection scene, having picked over 125 barrels from major distillers since its inception.\n\nBlackout works closely with local and national retailers and distillers to select unique bourbon and brown spirit expressions for their members. Their selections have included barrels from prestigious brands such as E.H. Taylor, Willett, Four Roses, Blanton's, Eagle Rare, W.L. Weller, and many others.\n\nIn addition to selecting private barrels, Blackout has also developed its own private label bottled under the Blackout brand. The group has shown innovation by repurposing used barrels from their selections to create distinctive blends, including wheated bourbon, bourye, and Four Roses expressions.\n\nThe success of Blackout's bourbon project is attributed to the passion and expertise of its membership, which has enabled them to consistently select high-quality and unique barrels. This focus on exceptional bourbon has not only satisfied their members but has also contributed to their philanthropic efforts through their Barrels for a Cause initiative.\n\n",

One taste of A Midwinter Night's Dram alongside a cozy fire will surely transport you to a dreamlike state. This limited release whiskey is a sumptuous marriage of our Rendezvous Rye finished in both port and French oak barrels. The rye forms a beautiful base of vanilla, caramel and cinnamon; the port barrels enhance with plums and dried fruits; the French oak provides a spice accent. For us, A Midwinter Night's Dram tastes like a proper Christmas plum pudding with lovely mulling spices, dried fruits, and cr\u00e8me anglaise.",

Prior to the official launch, Booker Noe, Jim Beam Master Distiller and grandson to the eponymous patriarch, would select these single barrel bottlings for family and friends during holiday periods. The lot number on the bottle is C-B-04-82. Speculation suggests that this means the bottle was distilled at Jim Beam's Clermont distillery (C), on the 4th of February (B) in 1982.  Jim Beam have a second distillery in Kentucky, on Boston Road, and this facility is now named after the late Booker Noe, who died in 2004.",

The delicate and fresh notes of honeysuckle, rose and lavender \u2013 which are very apparent on the nose at younger ages \u2013 contribute to the complexity and final character of Four Roses Bourbon. However, once we started aging Q batches longer for our Private Selection Single Barrel Program, the taste changed, melding oak tones from the extra maturation with floral tones to create a candied and rich Bourbon with much more depth and complexity than expressed at younger ages.",

Blended Rye Whiskey is a unique collaboration between Bardstown Bourbon Company and the innovative West Virginia Great Barrel Company. This expression showcases the potential of modern production techniques and forward-thinking cooperages.\n\nThe whiskey is a custom blend aged in cherry wood barrels that have been toasted using infrared technology, a process pioneered by West Virginia Great Barrel Company. This imparts a truly distinctive flavor profile to the rye whiskey blend.\n\nOn the nose, notes of almond, cinnamon, potpourri, and baked cherry mingle with traditional rye aromas of mint and herbal tea. The palate is luscious and well-balanced, with lightly tannic oak complementing rich berry compote flavors. The finish is luxurious, showcasing the synergy between the blended rye and the innovative cherry wood barrel maturation.\n\nAt 110 proof, this limited release celebrates the cutting-edge collaboration between two brands pushing the boundaries of whiskey innovation. The unique flavor exemplifies the potential when modern production meets expert blending and barrel finishing techniques.\n\n",

Older editions of Wild Turkey are particularly sought after amongst enthusiasts, notably for their remarkably different taste profile to modern Wild Turkey bottles. The distillery originally produced bourbon using cypress wood tanks but these were slowly phased out from 1984 until 1990. The other notable production change came in 2004 when the barrel entry proof was changed to 110, up from 107. The combination of these changes have resulted in serious demand for older vintage bottlings from the much loved distillery, with some believing 1990s era bottlings to be the distillery\u2019s best ever.",

            "description": "Perched on the limestone banks of the quaint Kentucky river town of Augusta, the Augusta Distillery is a beacon of tradition and craftsmanship. With its strategic location along the Ohio River, Augusta serves as a vital link connecting historic river towns to bustling cities. The distillery's dedication to quality and heritage is evident in every bottle, capturing the very essence of Kentucky's bourbon culture.\n\nTake the off ramp and wander along the very river banks where bourbon whiskey first flowed. Old Route 8 invites you to slow down and explore. This exceptional 8-year, cask strength; single barrel bourbon has been crafted in the true Kentucky tradition and patiently matured to offer an elevated experience that can be enjoyed every day. \n\nColor & Nose - Graham crackers, vanilla, and salted caramel greet you as you approach, suggesting that this is a true Kentucky Bourbon. These early notes give way to undertones of cedar and oak foreshadowing that this bourbon has come of age. \n\nPalate - The hints of flavor and complexity created upon nosing are reinforced on the palate.  Flavors of brown sugar, vanilla, and a dash of oak are balanced and revealed in smooth, cascading layers that only time and great liquid can deliver. \n\nFinsih - Long, smooth and lingering, the finish extends the joy of this pour, delivering a classic \u201cKentucky hug.\u201d Oak, baking spices, with a touch of sweetness are reminders that this is a traditional straight Kentucky bourbon that deserves further exploration.",

This expression is part of Smooth Ambler's renowned Old Scout line, which has garnered a dedicated following among bourbon enthusiasts since its introduction.\n\nSourced from MGP in Indiana, this bourbon features a high-rye mash bill of 60% corn, 36% rye, and 4% malted barley. The 9-year aging process in new charred oak barrels allows the whiskey to develop a rich complexity while maintaining a balance between the sweetness of corn and the spiciness of rye.\n\nSmooth Ambler's Old Scout line has an interesting history. It gained popularity in the early 2010s, but was temporarily discontinued in 2016 due to depleting stocks. The return of age-stated Old Scout releases, including this 9-year expression, marks a significant moment for the brand and its fans.\n\nThe Old Scout 9 Year is typically bottled at a robust 99 proof (49.5% ABV), which allows the full range of flavors to shine through. Bourbon enthusiasts often note its well-balanced profile, featuring notes of caramel, vanilla, and baking spices, complemented by the characteristic rye spiciness and a touch of oak from its extended aging.\n\nFor collectors and bourbon aficionados, Smooth Ambler Old Scout 9 Year represents a return to form for a beloved brand. It showcases the art of careful barrel selection and patient aging, making it a sought-after bottle for those who appreciate well-crafted, age-stated bourbons.\n\n",

            "description": "The Founders of Rolling Fork have been long-time admirers of the fine rums being distilled by the powerhouse Foursquare Distillery of Barbados. Thankfully,, the proprietors of that fine establishment are kind enough to let some casks make their way to independent bottlers. When a few casks of rum distilled in 1998 by Foursquare came available, Rolling Fork jumped at the opportunity to bring some of that well-aged rum stateside. The nose smells like someone baked an apple pie in a wood-fired oven using cedar and seasoned oak. In this long-aged rum,, the classic notes of a Foursquare distilled rum,, including floral and citrus make a brief appearance. However,, as may be expected from a rum aged 22 years,, the barrel influence delivers vanilla,, caramel,, and strong baking spice notes. Seasoned oak and baking spice notes take over and lead to a warming cedar and oak finish that lingers. This cask is bottled as nature intended at cask strength,, non-chill filtered,, and without any additives. The yield for this cask was 222 bottles.\n\n\n\n",

Known for their expertise in sourcing, aging, and blending exceptional whiskeys, NBC has gained a reputation for offering high-quality, unique expressions. While they don't distill their own spirits, their meticulous barrel selection process and innovative finishing techniques have earned them acclaim among whiskey enthusiasts.\n\nThis particular Single Barrel of the company's straight rye was bottled for Angel's Share Bourbon Society. The barrel was hand-selected by members of the society, showcasing their discerning palates and NBC's willingness to work closely with whiskey communities. Bottled at barrel proof, which typically ranges from 110 to 120 proof, this rye offers the full intensity of its flavors, making it a prized bottle for both collectors and rye enthusiasts.\n\nFor collectors, this Angel's Share Bourbon Society selection represents a unique opportunity to own a limited-edition whiskey that embodies both NBC's sourcing expertise and the collaborative spirit of the bourbon community. It stands as a testament to the growing trend of partnerships between craft bottlers and whiskey societies, resulting in truly distinctive releases.\n",

Currently there are more than 30,000 experimental barrels of whiskey aging in its warehouses. Each of the barrels has unique characteristics and experimental changes in the mash bill, types of wood, barrel toasts and more. Periodically, an experimental whiskey is bottled and sold on a limited basis.\n\nThis whiskey aged for six years and three months in a new American white oak barrel before it was rebarreled into a used American oak Zinfandel barrel. There it was aged for another eight years, making it a total of 14 years old. The expected wine fruitiness is absent in the initial palate, but is replaced with an exciting spiciness. It is not the rye-grain spice normally associated with bourbon, but a grape-vine herbal quality that slides across the tongue and lingers for what seems like forever. This is an epic whiskey with grandeur and grace. Old world quaffing of a vine and field m\u00e9lange.",

            "description": "The Blackened X Willett Masters of Whiskey Series Rye Whiskey Finished in Madeira Casks is a limited edition release that represents a bold collaboration between two renowned whiskey makers. This expression is the inaugural release in the BLACKENED's Master of Whiskey series, showcasing the talents of BLACKENED Master Distiller & Blender Rob Dietrich and Willett Distillery's Master Distiller Drew Kulsveen. The whiskey is a blend of high rye and low rye mashbills from Willett, aged for an average of 6.5 years, with some barrels as old as 8 years. After aging, the whiskey is finished in Madeira casks for 14 weeks and subjected to BLACKENED's proprietary Black Noise process, which uses low hertz frequencies from Metallica's music to vibrate the barrels, enhancing the interaction between the whiskey and the wood. The result is a whiskey with a deep amber color and a rich, complex flavor profile that includes notes of red raspberries, strawberry, mint, charred oak, brown sugar, and a hint of grape, leading to a finish with rhubarb, fig, plum, and spice. Bottled at 109.6 proof, this whiskey is a testament to the art of collaboration and innovation in the whiskey-making process.",

            "description": "Distilled in 1989 at the legendary Stitzel-Weller distillery in Shively, Lousville this exceptionally rare expression of bourbon was matured for 25 years! An incredible age statement even older than the industry leading Pappy Van Winkle 23 year, this limited offering was crafted from 11 barrels Julian Van Winkle carefully nurtured. After carefully assessing the barrels he vatted and tanked the liquid in 2014 to prevent any further wood interaction. Bottled at 100 proof just a tiny amount, 710 bottles, were produced from this 11 barrel run. A typical barrel should produce north of 270 bottles, so 25 years of maturation has lead to considerable angel's share. Bottled at 100 proof in a Glencairn crystal decanter and presented in a handmade wooden box. This presentation box was crafted with the staves from the 11 barrels in the vatting.",

            "description": "Bottled at 50% ABV, the Rock Hill Farms Single Barrel embodies the spirit of Kentucky's rich farmland along the river, its name paying homage to the fertile lands of the region. This bourbon was introduced as a single-barrel expression, showcasing the remarkable quality and distinctiveness of bourbon unblended from multiple barrels.\n\nTasting Experience: A journey into the heart of bourbon crafting, each sip of Rock Hill Farms Single Barrel echoes the traditional bourbon-making prowess.\n\nNose: The first whiff offers a sweet and spicy aroma, with hints of leather and a subtle touch of roasted marshmallow adding to the complexity.\n\nPalate: Contrary to the sweet notes in the aroma, the first sip presents a drier taste profile with flavors of dark chocolate and tobacco. The bourbon has a dry character, making it reminiscent of a fine single malt but without the peat, appealing especially to Scotch drinkers exploring bourbon.\n\nFinish: The finish is unique, with a gentle burn that travels in reverse, from the chest back up to the throat, lingering until the next sip. This trait makes it a desirable choice for sipping in cold weather, warming up the senses with each sip.\n\nThe Rock Hill Farms Single Barrel, with its higher-rye mash bill (believed to consist of 12% to 15% rye), showcases a different facet of bourbon, offering a taste that is as rich in history as it is in flavor. The bourbon was available in both 100 proof and 80 proof versions, and it resonated well with critics, scoring an impressive 98 points in some circles.",

Beam closed down the Old Taylor distillery and began bottling remaining stocks before using its own Beam spirit for the labels. This 1992 era bottling falls under that transitionary phase and could be using spirit from either the Old Taylor distillery of Jim Beam.

            "description": "Glenury Royal was founded by Robert Barclay in 1825, taking its name from the glen that runs through the Ury district. Weeks after opening in Stonehaven, a fire destroyed stocks of barley, along with the kiln and parts of the malting floor. Two weeks after the fire, worker James Clark died in an accident with the boiler. Robert Barclay died in 1854, and the distillery was auctioned to William Richie three years later. The maltings of Glenury Royal were closed in 1968. The distillery then kept producing malt whisky for almost two more decades, but eventually it was mothballed on May 31, 1985. In 1992 the owners decided to cease the malt whisky production at Glenury Royal for good. The buildings of the distillery were sold in 1993 to a property company who turned part of these buildings into apartments.",

Originating from barrel #288, situated in Warehouse H, Rick 48, and decanted on July 1, 1991, this bourbon displays a proof of 93, indicating an alcohol content of 46.5%.\n\nUpon olfactory examination, this bourbon presents a delightful trio of aromas, encompassing caramel, brown sugar, and sweet herbs, forming a sweet and inviting nose that beckons the taster.\n\nTransitioning to the palate, it initially unveils a sweet landscape dominated by the richness of brown sugar complemented by a hint of maple syrup. As the tasting journey progresses, a notable transition occurs, ushering in a spicier profile mid-palate, which adds a contrasting yet harmonious layer to the tasting experience.\n\nAlthough the review does not correspond to the specific barrel number H-48 288, it sheds light on the meticulous craftsmanship and the quality of flavors one might anticipate from a Blanton's Single Barrel Bourbon of the early 1990s era. This vintage bourbon, with its blend of sweet and spicy notes, embodies the timeless and cherished characteristics associated with Blanton's bourbon lineage.",

Older editions of Wild Turkey are particularly sought after amongst enthusiasts, notably for their remarkably different taste profile to modern Wild Turkey bottles. The distillery originally produced bourbon using cypress wood tanks but these were slowly phased out from 1984 until 1990. The other notable production change came in 2004 when the barrel entry proof was changed to 110, up from 107. The combination of these changes have resulted in serious demand for older vintage bottlings from the much loved distillery, with some believing 1990s era bottlings to be the distillery\u2019s best ever.",

Older editions of Wild Turkey are particularly sought after amongst enthusiasts, notably for their remarkably different taste profile to modern Wild Turkey bottles. The distillery originally produced bourbon using cypress wood tanks but these were slowly phased out from 1984 until 1990. The other notable production change came in 2004 when the barrel entry proof was changed to 110, up from 107. The combination of these changes have resulted in serious demand for older vintage bottlings from the much loved distillery, with some believing 1990s era bottlings to be the distillery\u2019s best ever.",

            "description": "An older bottling of Wild Turkey's signature 8 year old age statement bottled at 101 proof in 1989. Older editions of Wild Turkey are particularly sought after amongst enthusiasts, notably for their remarkably different taste profile to modern Wild Turkey bottles. The distillery originally produced bourbon using cypress wood tanks but these were slowly phased out from 1984 until 1990. The other notable production change came in 2004 when the barrel entry proof was changed to 110, up from 107. The combination of these changes have resulted in serious demand for older vintage bottlings from the much loved distillery, with some believing 1990s era bottlings to be the distillery\u2019s best ever.",

Older editions of Wild Turkey are particularly sought after amongst enthusiasts, notably for their remarkably different taste profile to modern Wild Turkey bottles. The distillery originally produced bourbon using cypress wood tanks but these were slowly phased out from 1984 until 1990. The other notable production change came in 2004 when the barrel entry proof was changed to 110, up from 107. The combination of these changes have resulted in serious demand for older vintage bottlings from the much loved distillery, with some believing 1990s era bottlings to be the distillery\u2019s best ever.",

Distilled just post WWII in 1953, this cask strength single malt was matured for an incredible 50 years. Glenury Royal spent much of its life providing malt whisky for blended Scotch whiskies such as the King William blend, but also saw small release as a malt whisky in the 1980s. The distillery was demolished in 1983 amid the Scotch whisky downturn of the era, and the site was turned into flats a decade later.",

The palate delivers intrepid notes of warm vanilla, oak, toasted nuts and a rich spiciness with hints of butterscotch or honey. The high alcohol by volume is intense and powerful yet inviting.

Created for connoisseurs familiar with cask strength whiskeys, this enormous taste profile reaches depths of flavor found only in the rarest of spirits. On the nose we get notes of dark chocolate, caramel and butter with earthy undertones of walnut and hazelnut. The palate delivers intrepid notes of warm vanilla, oak, toasted nuts and a rich spiciness with hints of butterscotch or honey. The high alcohol by volume is intense and powerful yet inviting. The deep and resonate finish on this bourbon is nothing short of legendary. Straight from the barrel is best served neat or with a splash of water. Un-filtered, un-cut, unbelievable.",

            "description": "The Blanton's Single Barrel Bourbon, based on a review from 1991, emanates a classic and well-rounded profile. Originating from barrel #288, situated in Warehouse H, Rick 48, and decanted on July 1, 1991, this bourbon displays a proof of 93, indicating an alcohol content of 46.5%.\n\nUpon olfactory examination, this bourbon presents a delightful trio of aromas, encompassing caramel, brown sugar, and sweet herbs, forming a sweet and inviting nose that beckons the taster.\n\nTransitioning to the palate, it initially unveils a sweet landscape dominated by the richness of brown sugar complemented by a hint of maple syrup. As the tasting journey progresses, a notable transition occurs, ushering in a spicier profile mid-palate, which adds a contrasting yet harmonious layer to the tasting experience.\n\nAlthough the review does not correspond to the specific barrel number H-48 288, it sheds light on the meticulous craftsmanship and the quality of flavors one might anticipate from a Blanton's Single Barrel Bourbon of the early 1990s era. This vintage bourbon, with its blend of sweet and spicy notes, embodies the timeless and cherished characteristics associated with Blanton's bourbon lineage.",

At a mere sixteen years old, he commenced his journey in the Distillery as an office boy, swiftly ascending to become a pioneering force in bourbon's evolution. Assuming the mantle of company president in 1921, he orchestrated a monumental expansion, propelling the Distillery from 44 to 144 buildings, solidifying its status as the era's premier bourbon producer.  Throughout his tenure until his retirement in 1952, Colonel Blanton curated his exclusive and scarce reserve of bourbon\u2014his personal selection\u2014meticulously stored within the hallowed halls of Warehouse H, now an iconic landmark. Though Colonel Blanton passed in the spring of 1959, his legacy endures.  In 1984, Blanton's eponymous bourbon made its debut, marking the inception of the first-ever commercially available Single Barrel Bourbon. A testament to Blanton's unwavering commitment to excellence, the Single Barrel Bourbon stands as a pioneering achievement, forever altering the landscape of bourbon craftsmanship.",

Pyrat 1623 Rum Cask rests in a hand-blown and cork-stoppered glass bottle. It is created from a secretive blend of nine Caribbean pot-still rums and contains rums that even before this blending have been aging for more than four decades. Once blended it is aged further, resting inside hand-selected imported French Limousine and Toasted American sweet oak barrels. These precious casks bestow upon their content a complexity and intense flavor profile.",

Created for connoisseurs familiar with cask strength whiskeys, this enormous taste profile reaches depths of flavor found only in the rarest of spirits. On the nose we get notes of dark chocolate, caramel and butter with earthy undertones of walnut and hazelnut. The palate delivers intrepid notes of warm vanilla, oak, toasted nuts and a rich spiciness with hints of butterscotch or honey. The high alcohol by volume is intense and powerful yet inviting. The deep and resonate finish on this bourbon is nothing short of legendary. Straight from the barrel is best served neat or with a splash of water. Un-filtered, un-cut, unbelievable.",

            "description": "Bottled at 50% ABV, the Rock Hill Farms Single Barrel embodies the spirit of Kentucky's rich farmland along the river, its name paying homage to the fertile lands of the region. This bourbon was introduced as a single-barrel expression, showcasing the remarkable quality and distinctiveness of bourbon unblended from multiple barrels.\n\nTasting Experience: A journey into the heart of bourbon crafting, each sip of Rock Hill Farms Single Barrel echoes the traditional bourbon-making prowess.\n\nNose: The first whiff offers a sweet and spicy aroma, with hints of leather and a subtle touch of roasted marshmallow adding to the complexity.\n\nPalate: Contrary to the sweet notes in the aroma, the first sip presents a drier taste profile with flavors of dark chocolate and tobacco. The bourbon has a dry character, making it reminiscent of a fine single malt but without the peat, appealing especially to Scotch drinkers exploring bourbon.\n\nFinish: The finish is unique, with a gentle burn that travels in reverse, from the chest back up to the throat, lingering until the next sip. This trait makes it a desirable choice for sipping in cold weather, warming up the senses with each sip.\n\nThe Rock Hill Farms Single Barrel, with its higher-rye mash bill (believed to consist of 12% to 15% rye), showcases a different facet of bourbon, offering a taste that is as rich in history as it is in flavor. The bourbon was available in both 100 proof and 80 proof versions, and it resonated well with critics, scoring an impressive 98 points in some circles.",

Presented in a stunning glass bottle featuring 24 sides to represent the 24 seasons in Japan, Hibiki exploded in popularity throughout the 2010s leading to many of the age stated expressions being discontinued. This 17 year old expression features very well matured Japanese spirit that is always in such short supply due to the extreme popularity of the harmonious blend.",

It was then finished in a Madeira Single Cask and bottled at 48.8% ABV. The resulting spirit was deemed extraordinary to the extent that the team behind East Asia Whisky Company decided to launch a new Collection: The \u201cYokai\u201d  Series \u2013 a collection of mythical creatures from Japanese folklore celebrating extraordinary achievements of select distilleries, starting with the Springbank distillery across exotic cask types and finishes. Only whiskies with a bouquet of flavours that manage to convince our panel to score a point score of 90 or above are selected for this exclusive and highly coveted and collectable series.\"",

It eventually passed into the hands of perhaps Scotland's greatest distilling dynasty, the Grants of Glenfiddich. Charles, the youngest son of William Grant procured the then-silent distillery from the government in 1920, and it remained in the family until they sold it to Wm. Teacher 40 years later. The Grants and Teachers were early champions of the single malt category, and distillery bottlings of Glendronach were produced for most of the 20th century until it was mothballed by Allied Distillers in 1996. The distillery was revived in 2002, and has since become one of the strongest single malt brands in the world. This whisky was distilled on 6th May 1994 and aged in single ex-Olosoro sherry cask for 26 years. One of 692 bottles.",

In 2021 they raised over $170,000 and in 2022 they raised nearly half a million. This is the third barrel of Blanton\u2019s they have selected, and we\u2019re honored to have a bottle to explore and share with our readers.   This particular barrel could be best described in a single word: balanced. It touches on all the right flavor notes one might come to expect from Blanton\u2019s, a little oak, honey, caramel, raisin, hints of spice, and some savory notes. The whiskey doesn\u2019t veer too far in any one direction, which makes it an ideal sipper and representative of the Original Single Barrel brand. It\u2019s another great selection from the team and supports a great cause.",

Earmarked from an early stage an ideal component in blended Scotch whiskies, Glenrothes has long been a key part of big brands such as Cutty Sark and Famous Grouse. Its relationship with the former, lead to a three decade-long association with London wine-merchants, Berry Brothers & Rudd, who first approached Highland Distillers about licensing the Glenrothes single malt brand in 1983, eventually trading the Cutty Sark blend with Edrington for full ownership of it in 2010. The distillery itself remained with Edrington through, and the two were reunited when the now hugely successful brand was returned in 2017. Releases from independent labels like this have also always been highly regarded. One of 390 of The Purim Edition 2021 .",

Barton the the master distiller of Glenmore and they produced their whiskey even through prohibition, being one of just six granted a license.\n\nIn 1944 the firm acquired Yellowstone and built the brand alongside Kentucky Tavern to be some of the most highly praised premium bourbons of the era.\n\nKentucky Tavern was typically bottled as an 8 year old product, so this 15 year bottling produced under the ownership of James Thompson and its first master distiller is exceptionally special!",

The brand emphasizes a commitment to quality by adhering to the Bottled-in-Bond Act of 1897, ensuring that all its whiskeys are aged for at least four years and bottled at 100 proof without chill filtration.\n\nNew Riff's flagship offerings include a Kentucky Straight Bourbon and a Kentucky Straight Rye, both crafted using non-GMO grains and a sour mash process that incorporates spent grains from previous distillations. The bourbon features a mash bill of 65% corn, 30% rye, and 5% malted barley, resulting in a rich flavor profile with notes of cherry wood and vanilla. The rye whiskey, made from 95% rye and 5% malted rye, delivers a vibrant, spicy character with minty and peppery aromas.\n\nThe distillery prides itself on its independence, allowing it to innovate without external pressures or shortcuts. New Riff has quickly gained recognition within the whiskey community for its robust flavors and commitment to craftsmanship, making it a notable player in the modern American whiskey landscape.\n",

                "Description": "Buffalo Trace Single Barrel Select is a premium expression from the renowned Buffalo Trace Distillery, showcasing the unique characteristics of individual barrels hand-picked for their exceptional quality and flavor profile.\n\nThis bourbon is crafted using Buffalo Trace's signature low-rye mash bill and aged for a minimum of seven years in new, charred American oak barrels. Unlike the standard Buffalo Trace Bourbon, which is a blend of multiple barrels, each bottle of Single Barrel Select comes from a single, carefully chosen barrel, offering a one-of-a-kind tasting experience.\n\nThe Single Barrel Select program allows retailers, bars, and bourbon enthusiasts to choose their own barrel, resulting in subtle variations between selections. This process highlights the artistry of bourbon-making and the impact of individual barrels on the final product.\n\nBottled at a robust 90 proof (45% ABV), Buffalo Trace Single Barrel Select typically offers a rich and complex flavor profile. Tasters can expect notes of vanilla, mint, and molasses on the nose, followed by flavors of brown sugar, toffee, dark fruit, and anise on the palate. The finish is often described as long and deep, with lingering sweet and spicy notes.\n\nFor collectors and bourbon enthusiasts, Buffalo Trace Single Barrel Select represents an opportunity to explore the nuances of barrel selection and the unique characteristics that emerge from individual barrels. These bottles are often highly sought after, not only for their quality but also for their limited availability and the story behind each selection.\n",

The palate reveals a delightful interplay of flavors, featuring notes of dried fruits, honey, and creamy toffee, with a subtle spiciness that enhances its depth.\n\nThe finish is smooth and lingering, characterized by warm oak and gentle vanilla notes. This expression beautifully balances the sweetness from the bourbon cask aging with the richer characteristics imparted by the sherry casks, resulting in a sophisticated dram that appeals to both seasoned whisky enthusiasts and newcomers alike.

This single malt Scotch whisky undergoes a unique maturation process, initially aged in ex-bourbon casks before being finished in European oak sherry casks, allowing it to develop a rich and complex flavor profile.\n\nOn the nose, the 17-Year Double Wood presents inviting aromas of oak, vanilla, and cinnamon sugar, complemented by hints of citrus and salted caramel. The palate reveals a delightful interplay of flavors, featuring notes of dried fruits, honey, and creamy toffee, with a subtle spiciness that enhances its depth.\n\nThe finish is smooth and lingering, characterized by warm oak and gentle vanilla notes. This expression beautifully balances the sweetness from the bourbon cask aging with the richer characteristics imparted by the sherry casks, resulting in a sophisticated dram that appeals to both seasoned whisky enthusiasts and newcomers alike. Balvenie Double Wood 17 Year is a testament to the distillery's heritage and craftsmanship, offering a luxurious tasting experience.\n",

Known for its rich history, this bourbon is named after William Larue Weller, a pioneer in using wheat as a secondary grain in bourbon production. The whiskey is aged for 12 years, allowing it to develop a complex flavor profile that balances sweetness and depth. With a proof of 90, Weller 12 offers a smooth drinking experience that appeals to both seasoned bourbon enthusiasts and newcomers alike.\n\nThe aroma of Weller 12 is inviting, featuring prominent notes of caramel, vanilla, and charred oak. As you sip, flavors of dried fruits such as apple and apricot emerge, complemented by hints of leather and sweet oak. The finish is notably satisfying; it begins gently before crescendoing with notes of sweet oak, cinnamon, and toasted pecans. This harmonious blend of flavors showcases the bourbon's craftsmanship and the unique characteristics imparted by its wheated mash bill. While it may not be the most complex bourbon available, Weller 12 excels in delivering a well-rounded and enjoyable tasting experience that has earned it a loyal following among whiskey lovers.\n\n",

This barrel was selected at the distillery by members of the BAXUS team, as well as two community members chosen to join the trip based on the bottles of bourbon they had listed in their collections on the app. The legendary whiskey writer David Tao also participated in selecting this bourbon, which was chosen from among seven other options as the most outstanding of the lot. This particularly small barrel yielded only 144 bottles, rather than the standard 200, further highlighting its concentrated flavor profile. It was matured for 5 years in an ISC Classic #4 charred barrel and fermented with yeast strain 927.\n\nWilderness Trail is one of the most innovative distilleries in the world, particularly renowned for its focus on yeast due to its long history as fermentation experts. In 2006, Dr. Pat Heist and Shane Baker founded FermSolutions, a consulting firm that created unique yeast strains and provided technical assistance to distilleries and breweries across the United States. After seven years, the firm had established itself so well in Kentucky distilling circles that Heist and Baker decided to set up their own distillery.\n\nWilderness Trail Distillery was built in 2013 in Danville, initially using a pot still before expanding twice to ramp up production. The founders initially focused on contract distillation for other brands but later began producing barrels for themselves, with varying mash bills, including a high-rye, wheated, and traditional rye mash bill. Their industry-leading experience in fermentation innovation means the yeast strain used for each mash is just as important as the grains or stills used. Whiskey is fundamentally made of water, yeast, and grain, with most modern distillers primarily adjusting the grain to create new products. Wilderness Trail's fundamentally scientific approach means these different yeast strains can create various types of spirits using the same mash bill, with one potentially being fruit-forward while another is heavier and earthier in character.\n\nTypically choosing to release their spirits around the 4- to 6-year mark, their expertise in all aspects of production has allowed them to create a flavor-first style of whiskey at a relatively young age. This innovative brilliance caught the eye of the large Italian drinks company Campari, which purchased a 70% stake in Wilderness Trail in October 2022, with the final 30% to be purchased in 2031. The deal was reportedly valued at $420 million, signifying just how valuable the new Kentucky producer has become in the market.",

The barley and cask type remain a mystery, with the final recipe undisclosed.    Whisky making is an ancient art, one that has intrigued and captivated for centuries. Black Art 10 is testament to this elusive mastery.     Pulling exclusively from Bruichladdich Distillery pre renaissance casks which have been patiently maturing on our island home for almost three decades, this finite single malt is secretly created by our Head Distiller, Adam Hannett.

With no rules and no restrictions, Black Art Edition 10.1 is unique and unrepeatable. A chance to experiment and push the boundaries of possibility, only Adam knows what has gone into crafting the precious 29 year old single malt.

This barrel was selected at the distillery by members of the BAXUS team, as well as two community members chosen to join the trip based on the bottles of bourbon they had listed in their collections on the app. The legendary whiskey writer David Tao also participated in selecting this bourbon, which was chosen from among seven other options as the most outstanding of the lot. This particularly small barrel yielded only 144 bottles, rather than the standard 200, further highlighting its concentrated flavor profile. It was matured for 5 years in an ISC Classic #4 charred barrel and fermented with yeast strain 927.\n\nWilderness Trail is one of the most innovative distilleries in the world, particularly renowned for its focus on yeast due to its long history as fermentation experts. In 2006, Dr. Pat Heist and Shane Baker founded FermSolutions, a consulting firm that created unique yeast strains and provided technical assistance to distilleries and breweries across the United States. After seven years, the firm had established itself so well in Kentucky distilling circles that Heist and Baker decided to set up their own distillery.\n\nWilderness Trail Distillery was built in 2013 in Danville, initially using a pot still before expanding twice to ramp up production. The founders initially focused on contract distillation for other brands but later began producing barrels for themselves, with varying mash bills, including a high-rye, wheated, and traditional rye mash bill. Their industry-leading experience in fermentation innovation means the yeast strain used for each mash is just as important as the grains or stills used. Whiskey is fundamentally made of water, yeast, and grain, with most modern distillers primarily adjusting the grain to create new products. Wilderness Trail's fundamentally scientific approach means these different yeast strains can create various types of spirits using the same mash bill, with one potentially being fruit-forward while another is heavier and earthier in character.\n\nTypically choosing to release their spirits around the 4- to 6-year mark, their expertise in all aspects of production has allowed them to create a flavor-first style of whiskey at a relatively young age. This innovative brilliance caught the eye of the large Italian drinks company Campari, which purchased a 70% stake in Wilderness Trail in October 2022, with the final 30% to be purchased in 2031. The deal was reportedly valued at $420 million, signifying just how valuable the new Kentucky producer has become in the market.",

            "description": "Weller Full Proof Single Barrel Select is a premium expression from Buffalo Trace Distillery's renowned Weller line of wheated bourbons. This offering showcases the full potential of individual barrels, bottled at a robust 114 proof (57% ABV) without chill filtration.

This barrel was selected at the distillery by members of the BAXUS team, as well as two community members chosen to join the trip based on the bottles of bourbon they had listed in their collections on the app. The legendary whiskey writer David Tao also participated in selecting this bourbon, which was chosen from among seven other options as the most outstanding of the lot. This particularly small barrel yielded only 144 bottles, rather than the standard 200, further highlighting its concentrated flavor profile. It was matured for 5 years in an ISC Classic #4 charred barrel and fermented with yeast strain 927.\n\nWilderness Trail is one of the most innovative distilleries in the world, particularly renowned for its focus on yeast due to its long history as fermentation experts. In 2006, Dr. Pat Heist and Shane Baker founded FermSolutions, a consulting firm that created unique yeast strains and provided technical assistance to distilleries and breweries across the United States. After seven years, the firm had established itself so well in Kentucky distilling circles that Heist and Baker decided to set up their own distillery.\n\nWilderness Trail Distillery was built in 2013 in Danville, initially using a pot still before expanding twice to ramp up production. The founders initially focused on contract distillation for other brands but later began producing barrels for themselves, with varying mash bills, including a high-rye, wheated, and traditional rye mash bill. Their industry-leading experience in fermentation innovation means the yeast strain used for each mash is just as important as the grains or stills used. Whiskey is fundamentally made of water, yeast, and grain, with most modern distillers primarily adjusting the grain to create new products. Wilderness Trail's fundamentally scientific approach means these different yeast strains can create various types of spirits using the same mash bill, with one potentially being fruit-forward while another is heavier and earthier in character.\n\nTypically choosing to release their spirits around the 4- to 6-year mark, their expertise in all aspects of production has allowed them to create a flavor-first style of whiskey at a relatively young age. This innovative brilliance caught the eye of the large Italian drinks company Campari, which purchased a 70% stake in Wilderness Trail in October 2022, with the final 30% to be purchased in 2031. The deal was reportedly valued at $420 million, signifying just how valuable the new Kentucky producer has become in the market.",

            "description": "Midleton Very Rare Barry Crockett Legacy is an exceptional Irish whiskey that pays homage to the legendary master distiller Barry Crockett, who retired in 2013 after an illustrious 47-year career at the Midleton Distillery. This single pot still whiskey represents the pinnacle of Irish whiskey craftsmanship and is highly regarded as one of the best in Midleton's range.\n\nThe whiskey is crafted using a blend of pot still spirits from light, medium, and heavy styles, showcasing the versatility and complexity of the single pot still category. It is primarily matured in first-fill bourbon casks, with a small portion aged in virgin American oak barrels, imparting a unique flavor profile.\n\nOn the nose, it offers soft and delicate aromas of acacia honey, white flowers, and baked bread, complemented by subtle notes of caramel toffee. The palate is remarkably complex, presenting a harmonious blend of citrus fruits, mixed peel, toffee, cocoa, honey, and Belgian waffles. There are also intriguing hints of engine oil and marshmallow, creating a truly multifaceted tasting experience.\n\nWhen reduced with water, the whiskey reveals even more delicate aromas and additional fruity notes. The palate becomes softer and more polished, with new flavors of boiled sweets, pear drops, kiwi fruit, and melon emerging.\n\nBottled at 46% ABV, this non-chill filtered whiskey offers a smooth, light, and soft finish that lingers pleasantly. The Barry Crockett Legacy has garnered numerous accolades, including Gold Medals at the Irish Whiskey Awards and Master awards at the Irish Whiskey Masters.\n\nThis limited edition release exemplifies the art of Irish whiskey-making and serves as a fitting tribute to Barry Crockett's enduring legacy in the world of fine spirits.\n\n",

            "description": "Evan Williams Single Barrel Vintage 2008, bottled in 2016, is a distinguished expression from Heaven Hill Distillery that showcases the art of single barrel bourbon production. As the only vintage-dated single barrel bourbon on the market, this release offers a unique tasting experience that captures a specific moment in time.\n\nDistilled in 2008 and aged for approximately 8 years before bottling in 2016, this bourbon has developed a complex flavor profile during its maturation in American white oak barrels. Bottled at 86.6 proof (43.3% ABV), it strikes a balance between flavor intensity and approachability.\n\nOn the nose, this vintage likely presents aromas of caramel, vanilla, and oak, complemented by hints of dried fruits and subtle spices. The palate may offer flavors of honey, toasted nuts, and cinnamon, with undertones of leather and tobacco. The finish is expected to be smooth and lingering, with a pleasant warmth and notes of oak and sweet corn.\n\nEach bottle of Evan Williams Single Barrel Vintage is marked with the date it was put into oak, the bottling year, and the exact barrel number, allowing enthusiasts to trace the bourbon's journey from grain to glass. This attention to detail and transparency has made the Evan Williams Single Barrel Vintage series a favorite among bourbon connoisseurs and collectors alike.\n\n",

As a single barrel selection, each bottle represents the unique characteristics of its source barrel, providing a one-of-a-kind tasting experience that can vary subtly between selections.\n\nTypically chosen by retailers, bars, or whiskey clubs, Weller Full Proof Single Barrel Select allows connoisseurs to explore the nuances of Buffalo Trace's wheated bourbon mashbill at its full, uncut strength. While not age-stated, these selections are generally aged for 5 to 8 years, developing a complex flavor profile that balances the sweetness of wheat with the depth of well-aged bourbon.\n\nThe Full Proof expression is particularly prized for its intensity and rich mouthfeel, offering a more robust experience compared to other Weller offerings. Its high proof and lack of chill filtration preserve the bourbon's natural oils and flavor compounds, resulting in a full-bodied whiskey that showcases the distillery's craftsmanship. Due to its limited availability and the reputation of the Weller brand, Weller Full Proof Single Barrel Select has become highly sought after by bourbon enthusiasts, often commanding premium prices and generating significant excitement when released.\n",

This whisky is crafted from 100% rye, aged for 100 months, and bottled at 100 proof. The distillation process originally utilized German-made Holstein stills, but now incorporates traditional copper pot stills for the second distillation. Zuidam distillery prides itself on being largely self-sufficient, growing most of the grain it uses, including rye, barley, wheat, and corn. The Millstone 100 Rye is noted for its rich and complex character, a testament to the meticulous production methods and the distillery's dedication to flavor-driven grain cultivation.",

A feeling of sweet young dessert wines more than Barolo to my nose. But certainly more restrained and elegant so far. With water: yellow plums, honey, delicate waxiness, sweet breakfast cereals and flower pollens. Mouth: some typical Springbank fatness with hessian and waxes mingling with stewed apricots, baked apple and various jammy tones. Feels like a Venn diagram of Springbank and generic wineyness with minimal crossover. But having said that, it's pretty good I think as most of these wine aspects seem reasonably gentle, sweet and easy. With water: honeys, soft waxes, lightly peppery, some shoe polish and more notes of apricot jam and impressions of yellow flowers. Finish: medium in length, a little drier, more on cereals, dried flowers, pepper and mineral oil. Comments: probably amongst the better of wine expressions in this series. Feels like a dram of two rather separate halves, but they co-exist in relative harmony so no complaints from me.",

Older editions of Wild Turkey are particularly sought after amongst enthusiasts, notably for their remarkably different taste profile to modern Wild Turkey bottles. The distillery originally produced bourbon using cypress wood tanks but these were slowly phased out from 1984 until 1990. The other notable production change came in 2004 when the barrel entry proof was changed to 110, up from 107. The combination of these changes have resulted in serious demand for older vintage bottlings from the much loved distillery, with some believing 1990s era bottlings to be the distillery\u2019s best ever.",

This variant was a higher proof version of the original Maker's Mark bourbon, featuring a proof of 101, equivalent to 50.5% ABV, contrary to the standard offering which is lower in proof.\n\nThis rare bourbon was estimated to be bottled sometime between the late 80s to early 90s, making it a treasured find for collectors. The gold wax edition was primarily sold in overseas markets until its discontinuation around the year 2000.\n\nThe Gold Wax edition, specifically from the 1990s, came in a 750 ml bottle and was known for its collectible nature. The bourbon itself is aged for a minimum of 5 years, which imparts a mature character to the spirit. Upon nosing, this bourbon reveals aromatic notes of aged wood and vanilla bean, which perfectly complement the sweet caramel and cinnamon spices that are present in the tasting profile.\n\nThe encapsulation of such rare editions in gold wax is a testimony to the distillery's innovative yet respectful nod to tradition, while also making a unique statement in the bourbon market. Each bottle of this edition reflects a blend of historical reverence and a quest for unique character in bourbon craftsmanship.",

            "description": "Barrel #767775 is a BAXUS-exclusive family reserve high-rye bourbon from the Wilderness Trail distillery, bottled at cask strength of 58.5% ABV. This barrel was selected at the distillery by members of the BAXUS team, as well as two community members chosen to join the trip based on the bottles of bourbon they had listed in their collections on the app. The legendary whiskey writer David Tao also participated in selecting this bourbon, which was chosen from among seven other options as the most outstanding of the lot. This particularly small barrel yielded only 144 bottles, rather than the standard 200, further highlighting its concentrated flavor profile. It was matured for 5 years in an ISC Classic #4 charred barrel and fermented with yeast strain 927.\n\nWilderness Trail is one of the most innovative distilleries in the world, particularly renowned for its focus on yeast due to its long history as fermentation experts. In 2006, Dr. Pat Heist and Shane Baker founded FermSolutions, a consulting firm that created unique yeast strains and provided technical assistance to distilleries and breweries across the United States. After seven years, the firm had established itself so well in Kentucky distilling circles that Heist and Baker decided to set up their own distillery.\n\nWilderness Trail Distillery was built in 2013 in Danville, initially using a pot still before expanding twice to ramp up production. The founders initially focused on contract distillation for other brands but later began producing barrels for themselves, with varying mash bills, including a high-rye, wheated, and traditional rye mash bill. Their industry-leading experience in fermentation innovation means the yeast strain used for each mash is just as important as the grains or stills used. Whiskey is fundamentally made of water, yeast, and grain, with most modern distillers primarily adjusting the grain to create new products. Wilderness Trail's fundamentally scientific approach means these different yeast strains can create various types of spirits using the same mash bill, with one potentially being fruit-forward while another is heavier and earthier in character.\n\nTypically choosing to release their spirits around the 4- to 6-year mark, their expertise in all aspects of production has allowed them to create a flavor-first style of whiskey at a relatively young age. This innovative brilliance caught the eye of the large Italian drinks company Campari, which purchased a 70% stake in Wilderness Trail in October 2022, with the final 30% to be purchased in 2031. The deal was reportedly valued at $420 million, signifying just how valuable the new Kentucky producer has become in the market.",

This barrel was selected at the distillery by members of the BAXUS team, as well as two community members chosen to join the trip based on the bottles of bourbon they had listed in their collections on the app. The legendary whiskey writer David Tao also participated in selecting this bourbon, which was chosen from among seven other options as the most outstanding of the lot. This particularly small barrel yielded only 144 bottles, rather than the standard 200, further highlighting its concentrated flavor profile. It was matured for 5 years in an ISC Classic #4 charred barrel and fermented with yeast strain 927.\n\nWilderness Trail is one of the most innovative distilleries in the world, particularly renowned for its focus on yeast due to its long history as fermentation experts. In 2006, Dr. Pat Heist and Shane Baker founded FermSolutions, a consulting firm that created unique yeast strains and provided technical assistance to distilleries and breweries across the United States. After seven years, the firm had established itself so well in Kentucky distilling circles that Heist and Baker decided to set up their own distillery.\n\nWilderness Trail Distillery was built in 2013 in Danville, initially using a pot still before expanding twice to ramp up production. The founders initially focused on contract distillation for other brands but later began producing barrels for themselves, with varying mash bills, including a high-rye, wheated, and traditional rye mash bill. Their industry-leading experience in fermentation innovation means the yeast strain used for each mash is just as important as the grains or stills used. Whiskey is fundamentally made of water, yeast, and grain, with most modern distillers primarily adjusting the grain to create new products. Wilderness Trail's fundamentally scientific approach means these different yeast strains can create various types of spirits using the same mash bill, with one potentially being fruit-forward while another is heavier and earthier in character.\n\nTypically choosing to release their spirits around the 4- to 6-year mark, their expertise in all aspects of production has allowed them to create a flavor-first style of whiskey at a relatively young age. This innovative brilliance caught the eye of the large Italian drinks company Campari, which purchased a 70% stake in Wilderness Trail in October 2022, with the final 30% to be purchased in 2031. The deal was reportedly valued at $420 million, signifying just how valuable the new Kentucky producer has become in the market.",

            "description": "Distilled in 1916, this bourbon was protected in bond by the American Medicinal Spirits Company from the Prohibition Act of 1920, which made alcohol production and consumption illegal. The whiskey was produced at the Anderson Distillery distillery in 1916, then owned by the infamous Whiskey Trust. The Trust was accused of engaging in several illegal activities, including intimidation of distillery owners who did not want to sell up to them. They acquired Anderson by some means in 1905, but were forced to close it down with the enactment of Prohibition in 1920. The stocks from the distillery were transferred to the Wathen warehouses that year, and bottled by the American Medicinal Spirits Company. The American Medicinal Spirits Company was one of only around 30 distilling companies to survive Prohibition of the 434 that existed prior. Exploiting the medicinal loophole was the brainchild of Otto Wathen, an idea which continues to prove its value today in the persisting image of his still ever-popular portfolio, which eventually included Old Grand-dad, Old Taylor and Old Crow, among many others. The American Medicinal Spirits Company was eventually subsumed by National Distillers (the revived legitimate face of The Whiskey Trust), who along with Schenley, Hiram Walker and Seagram's, became the big 4 American whiskey companies following the eventual repeal of Prohibition. The National Distillers acquisition of the AMS Co meant the return for brands such as Old Ramshead, bottled here in 1930. Sadly, as with many others, the Anderson Distillery never returned, and was razed and never rebuilt following the repeal of Prohibition.",

This batch is aged for 6 years, 10 months, and 10 days, and bottled at a robust 122.4 proof (61.2% ABV), offering bourbon enthusiasts a full-flavored and potent expression.\n\nThe nose of Pinkie's Batch is inviting and complex, featuring a harmonious blend of brown spices and vanilla notes. As you bring the glass closer, you're greeted by rich aromas of vanilla bean, reminiscent of opening a fresh package. Warm oak notes complement the vanilla, while hints of caramel, brown sugar, and baking spices add depth to the bouquet. A subtle touch of tobacco emerges in the background, accompanied by a gentle reminder of the bourbon's high proof.\n\nOn the palate, Pinkie's Batch delivers Booker's signature vanilla flavor in full force. The initial sip floods the mouth with a sweet and rich profile, showcasing heavy caramel and generous vanilla notes. These are complemented by nuances of peanut butter and dried fruits, particularly raisins and fresh dates. The sweetness is balanced by deeper, more complex flavors of molasses or sorghum, creating a dessert-like experience. As the flavors develop, subtle notes of barrel char, tobacco, pepper, and leather emerge, adding layers of complexity to the tasting experience.\n\nThe finish is lingering and well-rounded, with the interplay of sweet and spicy notes continuing to evolve. While the mouthfeel may be slightly thinner than some previous Booker's releases, the overall experience remains satisfying and true to the brand's reputation for bold, uncut, and unfiltered bourbon. Pinkie's Batch stands as a fitting tribute to Frederick Booker Noe, offering a bourbon that both honors tradition and delivers a memorable tasting experience.\n204_pinkies_batch/",

            "spiritType": "Bourbon",
            "description": "This 10 year old single barrel bourbon from Willett was crafted from a mashbill of 72% corn, 13% rye and 15% malted barley. It was matured in warehouse A on the 4th floor and was bottled at 65.8% Abv exclusively for LeNell's. \n\nA legendary name in the bourbon industry, LeNell's was founded by LeNell Camacho Santa Ana. Now a true industry icon, LeNell opened her first store in 2003 in Brooklyn and rapidly built the location into a premier American whiskey destination. She frequently collaborated with brands on special releases for the store and throughout her six year period of operating in Brooklyn, she established LeNell's as one of the greatest liquor stores on the planet. It was through her collaboration with KBD, otherwise known as Willett, that she would establish her own brand of rye whiskey called Red Hook Rye. This mature rye whiskey was sourced from Willett who held an extremely deep archive of well matured American whiskies.\n\nWillett had stopped distilling themselves in the 1980s amid a serious downturn in the market, instead pivoting to being a bottler of other distillery's products. This meant that they had slowly established a serious collection of barrels from various distilleries across Kentucky who were either closing amid the industry downturn, or rapidly scrambling to sell barrels at very low prices.\n\nLeNell contacted KBD and the company was more than happy to provide very old barrels of rye whiskey for her Red Hook Rye brand. She chose barrels that were 23 & 24 years of age, a set of ages that are unheard of in rye whiskey. This series of bottlings has become mythic amongst whiskey collectors and routinely breaks auction records each time one is unearthed. It is heralded as the greatest rye, if not the greatest American whiskey, ever produced. ",

                "Description": "This 10 year old single barrel bourbon from Willett was crafted from a mashbill of 72% corn, 13% rye and 15% malted barley. It was matured in warehouse A on the 4th floor and was bottled at 65.8% Abv exclusively for LeNell's. \n\nA legendary name in the bourbon industry, LeNell's was founded by LeNell Camacho Santa Ana. Now a true industry icon, LeNell opened her first store in 2003 in Brooklyn and rapidly built the location into a premier American whiskey destination. She frequently collaborated with brands on special releases for the store and throughout her six year period of operating in Brooklyn, she established LeNell's as one of the greatest liquor stores on the planet. It was through her collaboration with KBD, otherwise known as Willett, that she would establish her own brand of rye whiskey called Red Hook Rye. This mature rye whiskey was sourced from Willett who held an extremely deep archive of well matured American whiskies.\n\nWillett had stopped distilling themselves in the 1980s amid a serious downturn in the market, instead pivoting to being a bottler of other distillery's products. This meant that they had slowly established a serious collection of barrels from various distilleries across Kentucky who were either closing amid the industry downturn, or rapidly scrambling to sell barrels at very low prices.\n\nLeNell contacted KBD and the company was more than happy to provide very old barrels of rye whiskey for her Red Hook Rye brand. She chose barrels that were 23 & 24 years of age, a set of ages that are unheard of in rye whiskey. This series of bottlings has become mythic amongst whiskey collectors and routinely breaks auction records each time one is unearthed. It is heralded as the greatest rye, if not the greatest American whiskey, ever produced. ",

Thankfully,, the proprietors of that fine establishment are kind enough to let some casks make their way to independent bottlers. When a few casks of rum distilled in 1998 by Foursquare came available, Rolling Fork jumped at the opportunity to bring some of that well-aged rum stateside. The nose smells like someone baked an apple pie in a wood-fired oven using cedar and seasoned oak. In this long-aged rum,, the classic notes of a Foursquare distilled rum,, including floral and citrus make a brief appearance. However,, as may be expected from a rum aged 22 years,, the barrel influence delivers vanilla,, caramel,, and strong baking spice notes. Seasoned oak and baking spice notes take over and lead to a warming cedar and oak finish that lingers. This cask is bottled as nature intended at cask strength,, non-chill filtered,, and without any additives. The yield for this cask was 222 bottles.\n\n\n\n",

This special release is the result of a collaboration between Kentucky Owl's Master Blender John Rhea and Irish Whiskey Bonder Louise McGuane.\n\nOn the nose, this bourbon offers an inviting bouquet of aromas. Sweet notes of caramel and honey are prominent, balanced by just enough spice to tease the palate. There's also a subtle hint of fruit, adding complexity to the overall scent profile.\n\nThe palate delivers a harmonious blend of flavors. Long notes of caramel, butterscotch, and frosted cinnamon roll form the foundation, complemented by hints of chocolate and orange. A touch of candy floss and citrus peel adds brightness, while bright forest fruit notes emerge on the mid-palate. The blend showcases the best of both worlds - the rich caramel and vanilla notes from rare older bourbons, spice and fruit from higher rye bourbons, and sweetness and citrus from wheated bourbons.\n\nThe finish is long and satisfying, with lingering notes of vanilla pod and a balanced wood influence. There's also a subtle hint of nutmeg and clove spice, adding depth to the conclusion.\n\nThis St. Patrick's Edition features Kentucky straight bourbons aged 4 to 11 years, carefully selected and blended to create a robust, well-balanced bourbon experience. It successfully marries the bold, spicy character of Kentucky bourbon with the fruit-forward profiles beloved in Irish whiskey, resulting in a unique and enjoyable expression that appeals to enthusiasts of both styles.\n",

Roger Motlow, one of Lem\u2019s sons, received a letter about a whiskey judging contest in Brussels, Belgium. He handed the letter to Herb Fanning, his right hand man, and told him to take care of it. And indeed Mr. Herb did! He walked right out to the production line, pulled the first three bottles, and sent them on their way. According to Mr. Herb, when the folks in the advertising department found out he had pulled whiskey for the competition off the bottling line, they were a bit upset and asked why he hadn\u2019t looked for some special whiskey for the judging. To this Mr. Herb exclaimed: \u201cWhy all Jack Daniel\u2019s is special!\u201d The folks in Brussels seemed to agree. Jack Daniel\u2019s was awarded its sixth Gold Medal, the 1954 Star of Excellence.",

This barrel was selected at the distillery by members of the BAXUS team, as well as two community members chosen to join the trip based on the bottles of bourbon they had listed in their collections on the app. The legendary whiskey writer David Tao also participated in selecting this bourbon, which was chosen from among seven other options as the most outstanding of the lot. This particularly small barrel yielded only 144 bottles, rather than the standard 200, further highlighting its concentrated flavor profile. It was matured for 5 years in an ISC Classic #4 charred barrel and fermented with yeast strain 927.\n\nWilderness Trail is one of the most innovative distilleries in the world, particularly renowned for its focus on yeast due to its long history as fermentation experts. In 2006, Dr. Pat Heist and Shane Baker founded FermSolutions, a consulting firm that created unique yeast strains and provided technical assistance to distilleries and breweries across the United States. After seven years, the firm had established itself so well in Kentucky distilling circles that Heist and Baker decided to set up their own distillery.\n\nWilderness Trail Distillery was built in 2013 in Danville, initially using a pot still before expanding twice to ramp up production. The founders initially focused on contract distillation for other brands but later began producing barrels for themselves, with varying mash bills, including a high-rye, wheated, and traditional rye mash bill. Their industry-leading experience in fermentation innovation means the yeast strain used for each mash is just as important as the grains or stills used. Whiskey is fundamentally made of water, yeast, and grain, with most modern distillers primarily adjusting the grain to create new products. Wilderness Trail's fundamentally scientific approach means these different yeast strains can create various types of spirits using the same mash bill, with one potentially being fruit-forward while another is heavier and earthier in character.\n\nTypically choosing to release their spirits around the 4- to 6-year mark, their expertise in all aspects of production has allowed them to create a flavor-first style of whiskey at a relatively young age. This innovative brilliance caught the eye of the large Italian drinks company Campari, which purchased a 70% stake in Wilderness Trail in October 2022, with the final 30% to be purchased in 2031. The deal was reportedly valued at $420 million, signifying just how valuable the new Kentucky producer has become in the market.",

                "Description": "William Larue Weller was born into a distilling family in Kentucky in 1825  and launched his W.L. Weller brand in 1849. Originally a rectification business (creating 'whiskey' using neutral spirit  colouring and flavourings)  this all changed with the Bottled in Bond Act of 1897 and the death of Weller two years later. The company was left in the hands of the fiercely passionate Julian 'Pappy' Van Winkle I who having steered it safely through the wreckage of National Prohibition  established Old Weller alongside the newly acquired Old Fitzgerald labels and the flagship brands for the new Stitzel-Weller distillery in 1933. It was produced there for over 60 years  eventually being sold to the Sazerac Company in 1999  who distil it at Buffalo Trace using Pappy's recipe to this day. This is a 1978 bottling of the 7 year old Original 107 Proof wheated bourbon. This was produced by United Distillers at Stitzel-Weller  although by this point it had been renamed by its previous owners after flagship brand  Old Fitzgerald. The Stitzel-Weller company was officially established in 1933 at the repeal of National Prohibition in the US. It was the result of a merger between the A. Ph. Stitzel distillery and its biggest customer  W.L. Weller & Sons. The Stitzel-Weller distillery opened on Kentucky Derby day in 1935  and quickly developed a reputation for its high quality wheated bourbon  and its main brands were Old Weller  Old Fitzgerald and Cabin Still. The original ownership was shared between Alex T. Farnsley  Arthur Philip Stitzel and Julian Van Winkle. The former passed-away in 1941 and 1947  respectively  leaving the Van Winkle family as the sole heirs to the business. 'Pappy' died in 1965  having handed the reigns to his son  Julian II the year prior  who ran it until 1972 when the board of directors forced him to sell it to the Norton-Simon subsidiary  Somerset Imports. When they were bought over by the American arm of Scottish distillers  DCL  its subsequent iteration invested heavily in bourbon. So much so in fact  that their newly rebuilt Bernheim distillery had such capacity that Stitzel-Weller was rendered surplus to requirements. It was shut down in 1992. Still part of the Diageo portfolio  it has never re-opened and instead now houses the visitor experience for their Bulleit brand.",

The palate is full-bodied and vibrant, featuring flavors of cinnamon, vanilla, and dark chocolate. A subtle spiciness adds depth, while the finish is smooth and lingering, leaving behind notes of oak and sweet toffee.\n\nBlanton's iconic packaging includes a distinctive bottle shape and a horse-and-jockey stopper that has become a collector's item in its own right.

Chartreuse has been made by French monks for close to two centuries now, with the recipe a close guarded secret. The monks have been forced into exile at various times in the past, moving production to Spain at one point.",

As a single barrel selection, each bottle represents the unique characteristics of its source barrel, providing a one-of-a-kind tasting experience that can vary subtly between selections.\n\nTypically chosen by retailers, bars, or whiskey clubs, Weller Antique 107 Single Barrel Select allows connoisseurs to explore the nuances of Buffalo Trace's wheated bourbon mashbill at its full, uncut strength. While not age-stated, these selections are generally aged for about 6 years, developing a complex flavor profile that balances the sweetness of wheat with the depth of well-aged bourbon.\n\nThe Antique 107 expression is particularly prized for its intensity and rich mouthfeel, offering a more robust experience compared to other Weller offerings. Its high proof and lack of chill filtration preserve the bourbon's natural oils and flavor compounds, resulting in a full-bodied whiskey that showcases the distillery's craftsmanship. Often described as the \"Goldilocks\" of the Weller lineup, Antique 107 strikes a balance between age, proof, and price point.\n\nDue to its limited availability and the reputation of the Weller brand, Weller Antique 107 Single Barrel Select has become highly sought after by bourbon enthusiasts, often commanding premium prices and generating significant excitement when released. The single barrel format highlights the nuances in flavor that can occur between barrels, offering an opportunity to explore the depth and variety within the Weller profile.\n",

While not age-stated, these selections are generally aged for about 6 years, developing a complex flavor profile that balances the sweetness of wheat with the depth of well-aged bourbon.\n\nThe Antique 107 expression is particularly prized for its intensity and rich mouthfeel, offering a more robust experience compared to other Weller offerings. Its high proof and lack of chill filtration preserve the bourbon's natural oils and flavor compounds, resulting in a full-bodied whiskey that showcases the distillery's craftsmanship. Often described as the \"Goldilocks\" of the Weller lineup, Antique 107 strikes a balance between age, proof, and price point.\n\nDue to its limited availability and the reputation of the Weller brand, Weller Antique 107 Single Barrel Select has become highly sought after by bourbon enthusiasts, often commanding premium prices and generating significant excitement when released. The single barrel format highlights the nuances in flavor that can occur between barrels, offering an opportunity to explore the depth and variety within the Weller profile.\n",

Distilled in the spring of 1916 and bottled in the fall of 1934, this Bottled-in-Bond bourbon adheres to the strict standards set by the Bottled-in-Bond Act of 1897, ensuring it was aged for at least four years and bottled at 100 proof (50% ABV) under government supervision. This 18-year-old bourbon is noted for its exceptional aging, which has imparted deep, complex flavors and a rich character. The Bourbon de Luxe brand, known for its high-quality Kentucky straight bourbon whiskey, has a storied history, and this particular bottling represents a significant piece of American whiskey heritage. The long maturation period, spanning the Prohibition era, adds to its historical significance.",

Typically bottled at 93 proof, this bourbon is aged in charred American white oak barrels, allowing it to develop a complex character over time. \n\nOn the nose, Blanton's Single Barrel offers inviting aromas of honey, caramel, and ripe fruit, complemented by hints of citrus and spice. The palate is full-bodied and vibrant, featuring flavors of cinnamon, vanilla, and dark chocolate. A subtle spiciness adds depth, while the finish is smooth and lingering, leaving behind notes of oak and sweet toffee.\n\nBlanton's iconic packaging includes a distinctive bottle shape and a horse-and-jockey stopper that has become a collector's item in its own right. With its combination of quality, rarity, and craftsmanship, Blanton's Single Barrel remains a benchmark for bourbon aficionados and continues to capture the hearts of whiskey lovers around the world.\n\n\n",

The brand is based in Louisville and has quickly gained recognition for its unique approach to whiskey production, focusing on small-batch offerings that emphasize quality and distinct flavor profiles.\n\nThe company sources its whiskey primarily from the Midwest Grain Products (MGP) distillery, utilizing aged spirits and then subjecting them to secondary maturation in proprietary barrels developed in collaboration with Independent Stave Company. This process involves extensive research into toasting techniques, allowing Buzzard's Roost to create a variety of flavor profiles that enhance the whiskey's complexity. With 17 different proprietary toast profiles, each release showcases a careful balance of sweetness and spice, setting it apart in a crowded market.\n\nBuzzard's Roost has established a strong community presence, with the opening of the Buzzard's Roost Whiskey Row Experience in downtown Louisville, which serves as both a tasting room and an educational space for whiskey enthusiasts. The brand emphasizes its commitment to craftsmanship and innovation while fostering connections within the local community and the broader bourbon industry.\n\nWith a growing portfolio that includes various bourbons and ryes, Buzzard's Roost continues to expand its reach, currently distributing its products across 20 states. The brand's dedication to producing high-quality, flavorful whiskies has made it a notable player in the modern American whiskey landscape.\n",

This expression is typically aged for 13 years and bottled at barrel proof, offering a rich and intense drinking experience.\n\nOn the nose, Russell's Reserve Barrel Proof presents a complex bouquet of aromas. Deep notes of caramel, vanilla, and aged oak form the foundation, complemented by hints of dark fruit, leather, and baking spices. There's often a subtle undertone of cherry and citrus that adds brightness to the overall scent profile.\n\nThe palate delivers a bold and full-bodied flavor experience. Initial waves of rich toffee and vanilla give way to layers of dark fruit, particularly cherry and plum. The bourbon's age is evident in the well-integrated oak notes, which provide a pleasant tannic structure without overwhelming the other flavors. Baking spices, particularly cinnamon and nutmeg, add complexity and depth.\n\nThe finish is long and warming, with lingering notes of spice, oak, and a subtle sweetness. The high proof contributes to a pleasant warmth that doesn't overpower the nuanced flavors.\n\nThis expression showcases the Russell family's mastery of bourbon-making, offering a perfect balance of age, proof, and flavor complexity. It's a bourbon that appeals to enthusiasts seeking a rich, uncut, and unfiltered whiskey experience, embodying the best of what Wild Turkey can produce.\n\n",

This firm imported Chartreuse from the 1940s until 1969 and the tax stamp affixed to this bottle was introduced in 1961, thus suggesting this 1961-1969 date range. Older expressions of Chartreuse are highly sought after as the liqueur actively eats sugar, mellowing over time and creating an exceptionally rich and decadent spirit. Chartreuse has been made by French monks for close to two centuries now, with the recipe a close guarded secret. The monks have been forced into exile at various times in the past, moving production to Spain at one point. ",

The liqueur is made from a secret blend of 130 herbs, plants, and flowers, giving it its distinctive green color derived from chlorophyll. The production involves several stages, including maceration and distillation, followed by aging in oak casks. The monks continue to produce Green Chartreuse at the Aiguenoire distillery, maintaining the traditional methods and secrecy of the recipe.",

Older editions of Wild Turkey are particularly sought after amongst enthusiasts, notably for their remarkably different taste profile to modern Wild Turkey bottles. The distillery originally produced bourbon using cypress wood tanks but these were slowly phased out from 1984 until 1990. The other notable production change came in 2004 when the barrel entry proof was changed to 110, up from 107. The combination of these changes have resulted in serious demand for older vintage bottlings from the much loved distillery, with some believing 1990s era bottlings to be the distillery\u2019s best ever.",

This was produced by United Distillers at Stitzel-Weller  although by this point it had been renamed by its previous owners after flagship brand  Old Fitzgerald.

            "description": "Blanton's Takara Red is a special edition of the celebrated Blanton's Single Barrel Bourbon, exclusively released for the Japanese market. Part of the Takara series, which also includes Takara Black and Takara Gold, this expression is highly sought after by bourbon enthusiasts and collectors around the world.\n\nTakara Red is distinguished by its unique characteristics, including an aging process that is rumored to be a minimum of eight years, although this is not officially confirmed on the label. It is bottled at 93 proof (46.5% ABV), the same as the standard Blanton's Single Barrel, ensuring a robust flavor profile.\n\nThe packaging of Takara Red adds to its allure, featuring a distinctive red box with a woven texture and a deep maroon bag that contrasts with the brown bag of domestic Blanton's. The bottle is adorned with a gold-colored wax seal, similar to that found on Blanton's Straight From The Barrel. The label showcases light brown handwritten and printed portions, along with Japanese script spelling out \"Whiskey,\" further emphasizing its exclusivity.\n\nThe Takara Red series is particularly interesting for collectors due to its limited availability and the variations that can arise from individual barrel selections. Some special releases within this series, such as the HBA (Hotel Barmen Association Japan) Single Barrel picks, offer even more unique expressions.\n\nWhile many enthusiasts speculate about the potential superiority of the Takara series due to its rumored longer aging process, recent reviews suggest that modern releases may be more comparable in quality to standard Blanton's. Nevertheless, Takara Red remains a highly coveted expression in the bourbon world, often commanding premium prices on the secondary market.",

This blend is a harmonious combination of specially reserved malt whiskies that have been pot-distilled and aged at the renowned Yamazaki Distillery. The whisky offers a delightful introduction to Japanese whisky, known for its mildness and balance, with pleasant fruity notes of peach and banana, and a spicy finish. The key malt components of the Suntory Special Reserve are Hakushu, aged in white oak casks, and Yamazaki, contributing to its complexity and depth. The nose of this whisky is rich with dried fruits, including prunes, dates, apricot, and berries, with a hint of orange, while the palate is greeted with flavors of white pepper and bitter chocolate, leading to a medium-length finish with lasting fruits and a touch of oak bitterness.",

Older editions of Wild Turkey are particularly sought after amongst enthusiasts, notably for their remarkably different taste profile to modern Wild Turkey bottles. The distillery originally produced bourbon using cypress wood tanks but these were slowly phased out from 1984 until 1990. The other notable production change came in 2004 when the barrel entry proof was changed to 110, up from 107. The combination of these changes have resulted in serious demand for older vintage bottlings from the much loved distillery, with some believing 1990s era bottlings to be the distillery\u2019s best ever.",

It was matured in warehouse A on the 4th floor and was bottled at 65.8% Abv exclusively for LeNell's. \n\nA legendary name in the bourbon industry, LeNell's was founded by LeNell Camacho Santa Ana. Now a true industry icon, LeNell opened her first store in 2003 in Brooklyn and rapidly built the location into a premier American whiskey destination. She frequently collaborated with brands on special releases for the store and throughout her six year period of operating in Brooklyn, she established LeNell's as one of the greatest liquor stores on the planet. It was through her collaboration with KBD, otherwise known as Willett, that she would establish her own brand of rye whiskey called Red Hook Rye. This mature rye whiskey was sourced from Willett who held an extremely deep archive of well matured American whiskies.\n\nWillett had stopped distilling themselves in the 1980s amid a serious downturn in the market, instead pivoting to being a bottler of other distillery's products. This meant that they had slowly established a serious collection of barrels from various distilleries across Kentucky who were either closing amid the industry downturn, or rapidly scrambling to sell barrels at very low prices.\n\nLeNell contacted KBD and the company was more than happy to provide very old barrels of rye whiskey for her Red Hook Rye brand. She chose barrels that were 23 & 24 years of age, a set of ages that are unheard of in rye whiskey. This series of bottlings has become mythic amongst whiskey collectors and routinely breaks auction records each time one is unearthed. It is heralded as the greatest rye, if not the greatest American whiskey, ever produced. ",

The label also highlights that this whiskey is non-chill filtered, preserving its natural flavors and complexity. The liquid inside the bottle has a rich amber color, indicative of its maturation process. This particular batch, Batch 3, is known for its bold and spicy profile, with notes of ginger, nutmeg, and cinnamon on the nose, followed by flavors of black and Sichuan peppers, vanilla, green apple, peaches, and toasted hazelnuts on the palate. The finish is long and creamy, with lingering notes of milk chocolate, fresh fruit, and nuts. Overall, Blue Spot 7 Year Old Cask Strength is a testament to the quality and craftsmanship of Mitchell & Son, offering a unique and flavorful experience for whiskey enthusiasts.",

This combination allows for a rich and multifaceted flavor profile, where the American Oak imparts classic notes of vanilla and soft fruits, while the sherry casks contribute depth with hints of dried fruit and nutty characteristics.\n\nBottled at 48% ABV, this limited batch release offers an approachable yet flavorful experience. On the nose, one can expect a harmonious blend of sweet orange, ginger marmalade, and a medley of fruits including apricots and peaches, underscored by abundant vanilla notes. The palate presents a full-bodied experience with flavors of soft red apple, peaches, hazelnuts, and vanilla toffee. The finish is characteristically long, sweet, and indulgent, reflecting the whisky's careful maturation and exceptional cask selection.",

This 2024 edition is a testament to Heaven Hill's rich history and commitment to quality.\n\nBottled at a robust 120 proof (60% ABV), this Kentucky Straight Bourbon Whiskey is crafted from a mash bill of 78% corn, 10% rye, and 12% malted barley. The whiskey was distilled on December 29, 2005, under the supervision of the legendary late Parker Beam and aged for 18 years in Rickhouse 1I at the Bernheim location.\n\nOn the nose, this bourbon offers rich aromas of cherry, ranging from cherry cough syrup to cherry cola, complemented by notes of musty oak, graham cracker, and molasses. The palate is equally complex, featuring flavors of charred oak, cooked Morello cherries, light root beer, and vanilla extract.\n\nAs part of Heaven Hill's annual spring release, this small batch bourbon is highly limited and sought after by collectors and enthusiasts alike.\n\nThe Heaven Hill Heritage Collection 18 Year Small Batch demonstrates the artistry of long-term bourbon maturation, balancing intense oak influence with the sweet and spicy notes characteristic of Heaven Hill's high-quality distillate.\n",

            "description": "A bottling of Chandler Gin made by the Stewart Distilling Co in Philadelphia. This was bottled in the early 1900s. Robert Stewart was an Irishman who emigrated to Baltimore in the middle of the 19th century. He started his distillery in 1886 in Highlandtown and then officially incorporated his business in 1894. The firm produced \"Robert Stewart Rye\" and contracted H.B. Kirk in New York for bottling, a firm which also bottled Old Crow Rye from W.A. Gaines & Co. Robert Stewart decided to retire and sell the company in 1897 to the Carstairs of Philadelphia. In 1898, the same year this rye whiskey was produced, a news article claims the distillery had the capacity to produce 1200-1500 gallons of whiskey per day with an expansion planned to up production to 3000 gallons per day. The Carstair Brothers ran the firm themselves from 1898 until 1908 when the firm consolidated its holdings, creating the Stewart Distilling Company and merged its historical Carstairs, Mcall & Co company into one. The distillery and firm operated until 1919. As prohibition loomed the Carstairs Mcall & Co firm chose to liquidate the site, but J.H. Carstair stepped in and purchased the distillery himself. Prohibition hampered any chance of revival however and by 1921 J.H. Carstair was out of the business. The site was sold and continued to hold liquor onsite through the early years of prohibition, even having its liquid stolen by bootleggers in 1923. The moonshiners tunnelled into the distillery from a nearby empty house and pumped the whiskey out of the barrels into containers next door. In 1924 the vice president Jacob Katz of Stewart Distillery and the manager of nearby Sherwood distillery were caught selling both barrels and cases of whiskey, actions outlawed by prohibition. Finally in 1925 the distillery was put up for sale and dismantled, being fully purchased by the Crown Oil & Wax Company in 1927. This specific bottle bears no size or strength, but one has reportedly been opened and proofed as approximately 110. We estimate this to be a 4/5th quart/750ml bottle size. \n\nBaxus holds a number of these assets so please carefully inspect images for their fill level and condition.",

This specific bottle bears no size or strength, but one has reportedly been opened and proofed as approximately 110. We estimate this to be a 4/5th quart/750ml bottle size. \n\nBaxus holds a number of these assets so please carefully inspect images for their fill level and condition.",

This inaugural release features three distinct expressions: a Kentucky Straight Bourbon Whiskey, a Kentucky Straight Wheated Bourbon Whiskey, and a Kentucky Straight Rye Whiskey.\n\nEach expression in the series uses a unique corn varietal, Beck's 6158, developed in collaboration with Beck's Hybrids and grown locally by Peterson Farms within a few miles of Heaven Hill's facilities in Nelson County, Kentucky. This focus on locally sourced, high-starch corn sets the foundation for a truly grain-to-glass experience.\n\nThe Wheated Bourbon, bottled at a robust 121 proof, uses a mash bill of 52% corn, 35% wheat, and 13% malted barley. This expression pushes the boundaries of Heaven Hill's traditional wheated bourbon recipes, resulting in a rich and complex flavor profile.\n",

After Lincoln's retirement from Brown-Forman, where he had developed renowned brands like Woodford Reserve, he came out of retirement to create a whiskey that would challenge traditional bourbon-making techniques.\n\nThe brand's innovative approach centers on secondary barrel finishing, a technique more commonly used in Scotch whisky production. Lincoln and Wes began experimenting with aging bourbon in port wine casks, a method that was initially met with skepticism from bourbon purists. The brand's name originated from Lincoln's joke that while the \"angel's share\" is the portion of whiskey lost to evaporation during aging, the remaining liquid must be what the angels would envy.\n\nIn 2013, Angel's Envy broke ground on its distillery in downtown Louisville, becoming the first full-production whiskey distillery in the city's urban center. This historic location, situated on Whiskey Row, symbolizes the brand's commitment to both innovation and bourbon heritage. The distillery was completed in 2016 and has since expanded, welcoming 10,000 visitors annually.\n\nNow owned by Bacardi, Angel's Envy has grown from a family project to a nationally and internationally distributed brand. They continue to push boundaries by experimenting with various finishing techniques, including rum and sherry cask finishes, while maintaining a commitment to quality and craftsmanship passed down through three generations of the Henderson family.\n\n",

            "description": "Peregrine First Flight is the first 20 year old age-stated whisky we have released and is the culmination of a whisky-making process that we have been developing for the last several years. Our love for Canadian whisky is rooted in blending. Canadian whisky is made by distilling and aging individual grains in order to maximize the creative flexibility of the blender. With Peregrine we took this process a step further. We created a blend and then recasked it into French Limousin, American ex-Cognac and new American oak casks for a 5-month further maturation. After 5 months we took the best 7 casks and reblended them to create Peregrine.  Peregrine started as a blend of 20 year old rye aged in ex-Speyside scotch casks, 22 year old corn in new American oak, 23 year old corn in refill oak, 24 year old corn in ex-bourbon and 27 year old corn in Hungarian oak. Before we further matured this whisky it was blended to create a balanced whisky with a clean palate. The nose was bright with milk chocolate, honeysuckle, orchard fruits, caramel and black pepper. The palate and body were light and fresh. In a synesthetic way, we planned for the original blend to consist of bright, vibrant colors, knowing the further maturation would darken, enliven and enrich the entire profile and tenor of the whisky.  After its further maturation in three different oak types and its reblend, the final whisky is elegant and decadent. The marvel of this whisky is the perfect integration of all the flavors across the entire palate, deep into the finish.  Flavor Notes The moment you pour Peregrine, candied peaches, exotic wood spice, lavender, milk chocolate and ground cashews flow from the glass in one harmonious chord. The combination of fruit, spice, wood, vanillin and citrus are exceptionally balanced with only a slight emphasis on the bouquet of glazed fruit notes - a symphony of clementine, raspberry and red apple.  Peregrine lands on the palate with a wintry freshness, followed almost immediately by a surging, fruity oiliness. The elegant mid palate thickens into a viscous combination of chocolate, orange and vanilla bean. As it spreads to the side palates, it transitions into cinnamon and herbaceous spice. The back of the palate erupts with sandalwood, lavender, shortbread and a touch of black pepper, barely hinting at its 126.2 proof. The momentary tannic warmth precedes a three stage finish. First comes a sweet gingerbread baking spice, followed by rich tonka bean and orange blossom water and finally, a lingering shortbread with mint leaf that echoes eternal.  Why We Made This Whisky The word \u201cperegrine\u201d derives from the medieval Latin \u201cfalco peregrinus\u201d which translates to \u201cpilgrim falcon.\u201d In medieval times, falconers who wanted to train peregrines could not access their incredibly high nests. In order to train a peregrine, a falconer had to capture one on its \u201cfirst flight,\u201d its first migratory pilgrimage. Hence the name \u201cfalco peregrinus.\u201d  We created Peregrine because we love the process of shaping and reshaping whisky through blending and maturation. When you recask a whisky you allow it to change its trajectory, move in a new direction. By blending the whisky before further maturation, we controlled the starting point. Good maturation of whisky requires matching the wood to the distillate, but we thought - what if we shape the liquid itself to best match a particular maturation regimen?  We named this whisky \u201cPeregrine\u201d because it resonates with our ethos and our belief that Found North is an ongoing exploration, a continual journey. And we named this collection \u201cThe High Altitude Collection\u201d because we believe this process of creating a blend for the purpose of further maturation will take great whisky to new heights.",

The May 2015 inaugural release of Michter\u2019s US1 Barrel Strength Rye marked yet another milestone in that quest. For maturation, the Rye distillate is entered into the barrel at 103 proof, rather than a more industry standard higher proof. Barrel entry at a lower proof of 103 rather than a higher proof costs Michter\u2019s more money in terms of barrels and warehousing, but we believe it yields a richer, smoother, more full-bodied whiskey after proper maturation.",

The May 2015 inaugural release of Michter\u2019s US1 Barrel Strength Rye marked yet another milestone in that quest. For maturation, the Rye distillate is entered into the barrel at 103 proof, rather than a more industry standard higher proof. Barrel entry at a lower proof of 103 rather than a higher proof costs Michter\u2019s more money in terms of barrels and warehousing, but we believe it yields a richer, smoother, more full-bodied whiskey after proper maturation.",

This firm imported Chartreuse from the 1940s until 1969 and the tax stamp affixed to this bottle was introduced in 1961, thus suggesting this 1961-1969 date range. Older expressions of Chartreuse are highly sought after as the liqueur actively eats sugar, mellowing over time and creating an exceptionally rich and decadent spirit. Chartreuse has been made by French monks for close to two centuries now, with the recipe a close guarded secret. The monks have been forced into exile at various times in the past, moving production to Spain at one point. ",

Its origins trace back to 1605 when Fran\u00e7ois Hannibal d\u2019Estr\u00e9es presented a manuscript containing a recipe for an \"elixir of long life\" to the monks. This recipe was refined over the centuries, leading to the creation of Yellow Chartreuse in 1838, which was officially named and trademarked in 1852. Unlike its Green counterpart, Yellow Chartreuse is made from a grape-based distillate and gets its vibrant hue from saffron. It features a blend of 130 botanicals, including herbs, plants, and flowers, and its exact recipe remains a closely guarded secret. The liqueur is known for its milder, sweeter profile compared to Green Chartreuse, making it a versatile ingredient in cocktails or enjoyable on its own. The production process involves several weeks of meticulous work, including maceration and aging in oak casks, ensuring its complex and evolving flavor profile.",

            "description": "A storied brand, Chicken Cock whiskey has been available since the 1860s with the firm Tarr & White introducing the label and producing their whiskey at the \"Bourbon Distillery\" in bourbon county. The label and distillery changed hands numerous times, but when prohibition was enacted in 1920 the brand was acquired by the Distillers Corporation Limited in Canada. With alcohol now illegal to sell in the United States the Canadian firm switched from Chicken Cock's traditional glass bottles to sealed tin cans such as this one! The can contains a bottled in bond pint of pure Canadian rye whiskey and comes complete with a key on the top to pull the metal strip, opening the container. Distillers Corporation Limited notoriously smuggled vast quantities of these tins into the United States, often through French rum smugglers, resulting in Chicken Cock being a particular speakeasy favourite of the 1920s. So much so that the whiskey became the house pour of the notorious Cotton Club in New York, arguably one of history's most famous speakeasies. Chicken Cock changed hands in the later years of prohibition from the Canadian firm, with the American Medicinal Spirits Company now bottling the brand from their existing American produced stocks. AMS became National Distillers after prohibition and attempted to revive the brand before giving up in the 1950s. This sealed tin of pure Canadian rye is a true glimpse into the speakeasy culture of the 1920s and is a genuine time capsule of a long gone era. ",

There is roasted peanut, a bit of almond, dunnage (combination of damp earth and wood), tobacco, but also orange marmalade, prune and custard. It's not overly friendly, but has great character and complexity.\nTaste\nMedium to full-bodied, with good balance, a bit sweet but with good acidity to balance this. The jammy and dried fruit gain weight here. Then there is this leafy and earthy side again, with maybe a slight trace of smoke. The ex-sherry oak plays a good role by giving that rancio feeling: leather, nuts, balsamico, a bit of menthol.\nFinish\nQuite long, nicely spicy but not bitter or aggressive. Nutmeg, cinnamon, ginger bread, old leather, dried fruit and orange zest.",

His dedication to distilling began at the close of the Civil War when he purchased O.F C. Distillery. There, he developed innovative techniques that are still in use today. Made by hand, this Small Batch Bourbon Whiskey has been aged inside century old warehouses constructed by E.H. Taylor, Jr.  Barrels are evaluated and selected to create a perfect blend of distinctive character that is like no other. This bourbon is a true sipping bourbon that honors the uncompromising legacy of E.H. Taylor, Jr.\nTasting Notes:\nTastes of caramel corn sweetness, mingled with butterscotch and licorice. The aftertaste is a soft mouth-feel that turns into subtle spices of pepper and tobacco.\n\n",

This small batch, Bottled-in-Bond 100 proof straight rye whiskey pays tribute to the former Distillery owner with a unique rye whiskey reminiscent of days long past.\nTASTING NOTES\n\nAn altogether different recipe and profile than Sazerac Rye, this recipe contains just rye and malted barley, no corn. The result is an aroma full of dried fruit, black pepper, and a touch of fresh dill. A small sip brings an array of flavors both sweet and savory with a terrific balance of dark spices and subtle caramel overtones. The finish is especially pleasing with an oaky dryness that lingers just long enough.\n\n\"Simply spectacular!\" - John Paddon, blind tasting notes - 2015 International Whisky Competition\n",

Older editions of Wild Turkey are particularly sought after amongst enthusiasts, notably for their remarkably different taste profile to modern Wild Turkey bottles. The distillery originally produced bourbon using cypress wood tanks but these were slowly phased out from 1984 until 1990. The other notable production change came in 2004 when the barrel entry proof was changed to 110, up from 107. The combination of these changes have resulted in serious demand for older vintage bottlings from the much loved distillery, with some believing 1990s era bottlings to be the distillery\u2019s best ever.",

                "Description": "The Wild Turkey 101 \"Split Label\" is a highly regarded expression from the mid-1990s that holds a special place in bourbon history. This 12-year-old bourbon, bottled at 101 proof (50.5% ABV), earned its nickname from its distinctive label design featuring a split between gold and cream colors. Produced during a time when Wild Turkey had access to well-aged stocks, the Split Label represents a transition period between the iconic \"Cheesy Gold Foil\" bottles and more modern releases.\n\nTasting notes for the Split Label often describe a complex and robust flavor profile. The nose typically offers a rich bouquet of caramel, vanilla, and toasted oak, complemented by hints of dried fruit, tobacco, and spices. On the palate, enthusiasts report a full-bodied experience with flavors of butterscotch, maple syrup, dark cherry, and a pronounced spiciness characteristic of Wild Turkey's high-rye mashbill. The finish is long and warming, with lingering notes of oak, vanilla, and a touch of leather. While some collectors argue that the Split Label may not quite reach the legendary status of its Cheesy Gold Foil predecessor, it's still highly sought after for its quality and historical significance, representing a time when age-stated bourbons were more readily available.\n",

The palate is rich and full-bodied, with immediate flavors of honey, oak, and cherry pie, complemented by cr\u00e8me br\u00fbl\u00e9e and burnt orange peel. The mouthfeel is notably viscous, providing a luxurious coating sensation. The finish is long and dessert-like, featuring Luxardo cherries, spearmint, black pepper, and baking spices, with lingering notes of oak and honey. This bourbon's unique honey cask finish offers a distinctive and sophisticated drinking experience that stands out in the world of premium bourbons.\n",

                "Description": "From the producer: \n\n\"Colonel Edmund Haynes Taylor, Jr. is widely considered one of the founding fathers of the bourbon industry, fighting for the Bottled-in-Bond Act of 1897, nearly three decades after he purchased what is now called Buffalo Trace Distillery. During his time, Taylor implemented several innovative methods still used today, including climate controlled aging warehouses. Many of the barrels selected for the E.H. Taylor, Jr. Single Barrel are aged in Warehouse C, which was built by Taylor in 1881 and proven to be an excellent aging warehouse. Each barrel is hand-picked and Bottled in Bond at 100 proof to honor its namesake.\"\n\nThe E.H. Taylor brand is renowned throughout the whiskey world for its history as well as its quality. The Single Barrel Select series is made up of \"store picks,\" with this particular instance having been bottled for Lueken's Wine and Spirits in Florida.",

Like various other figures in the Kentucky whiskey industry, Taylor is often referred to in public relations materials as a \"Colonel\", since he held the honorary title of Kentucky Colonel. The honorary title resembles that of the military rank but is not actually associated with military service and has primarily been used for public relations purposes (e.g., by \"Colonel\" Harland Sanders, the founder of Kentucky Fried Chicken). Taylor started and owned seven different distilleries throughout his career, the most successful being the O.F.C. and Carlisle distilleries, the forerunners of today's Buffalo Trace Distillery.",

Adolph Hirsch commissioned 400 barrels to be filled by Michter's master distiller Dick Stoll. These barrels were left to mature in Pennsylvania until Michter's shut its doors in the 1980s. The stocks were purchased by liquor legend Gordon Hue, who then contracted Julian Van Winkle to bottle the barrels. A number of different versions of this 400 barrel batch were released, some with wax tops and a hand-full exclusive to the Japanese market. The stocks eventually changed hands. This is the bourbon heralded by Chuck Cowdery as \"The best bourbon you'll never try\" in his book. The mythos of the Michter's pot still product has become legend and resulted in this 1974 batch being amongst the most sought after bourbon.\n\nThis is the 2003 gold foil release which saw the remaining tanked liquid bottled by Julian Van Winkle at Buffalo Trace. This is also the widest available release and see sizeable exports.",

Introduced in 2013, it serves as a more accessible counterpart to the renowned George T. Stagg bourbon, which is part of the annual Buffalo Trace Antique Collection. Stagg Jr. is a barrel-proof bourbon, typically bottled between 126 and 134 proof, and is aged for approximately 8-9 years using Buffalo Trace's high-rye mash bill #1. Released in batches multiple times a year, each batch may vary slightly in proof and flavor profile. Despite its \"Jr.\" designation, the brand has gained a strong reputation among bourbon enthusiasts for its quality and bold character. In 2022, Buffalo Trace announced that they would drop the \"Jr.\" from the name, simply calling it \"Stagg\" going forward, reflecting the bourbon's growth in popularity and status within the whiskey community. While more readily available than its senior counterpart, Stagg Jr. has become increasingly difficult to find due to high demand, often selling well above its suggested retail price on the secondary market.",

Its flavor characteristics include notes of caramel, vanilla, dark fruits, and toasted oak, with a smooth and balanced finish. The Weller 12 Year has gained significant popularity among bourbon enthusiasts, often commanding prices well above its suggested retail price due to its reputation and limited availability.\n\nBuffalo Trace carefully selects and ages these barrels, creating a bourbon that showcases the depth and complexity that comes from extended maturation. While the bourbon's proof and age statement are becoming more common in the market, Weller 12 Year continues to be highly sought after by collectors and whiskey lovers alike.\n",

Each bottle represents a distinct barrel, providing subtle variations in flavor profile while maintaining the core characteristics of Eagle Rare's 10-year bourbon.\n\nThe Single Barrel Select remains highly sought after, with limited availability and significant demand among whiskey collectors and enthusiasts. Bottled at the standard 90 proof, these selections showcase Buffalo Trace's commitment to quality and craftsmanship in bourbon production.\n\n",

Following distillation, it's rested for six months in stainless steel vats, allowing the flavors to meld and develop complexity.\n\nOn the nose, Trump Super Premium Vodka offers dry, earthy scents of grain and paraffin, complemented by subtle notes of jasmine, flowers, moss, and a hint of soot. The palate presents a better-than-average grain focus and viscosity, evolving into an off-dry profile with intense breakfast cereal and biscuit-like flavors. The finish is described as oily/creamy with a snack cracker-like quality.\n\nLaunched in 2005 with the slogan \"Success Distilled,\" this vodka was initially promoted as a luxury brand aimed at competing with established premium vodkas. However, despite its initial fanfare, Trump Vodka was discontinued in the United States in 2011 due to poor sales performance. It's worth noting that the brand continues to have a presence in certain international markets, particularly in Israel, where it has found popularity around the Jewish holiday of Passover.",

The finish is described as oily/creamy with a snack cracker-like quality.\n\nLaunched in 2005 with the slogan \"Success Distilled,\" this vodka was initially promoted as a luxury brand aimed at competing with established premium vodkas. However, despite its initial fanfare, Trump Vodka was discontinued in the United States in 2011 due to poor sales performance. It's worth noting that the brand continues to have a presence in certain international markets, particularly in Israel, where it has found popularity around the Jewish holiday of Passover.",

As the only vintage-dated single barrel bourbon on the market, this release offers a unique tasting experience that captures a specific moment in time. Distilled in 2008 and aged for approximately 8 years before bottling in 2016, this bourbon has developed a complex flavor profile during its maturation in American white oak barrels. Bottled at 86.6 proof (43.3% ABV), it strikes a balance between flavor intensity and approachability. On the nose, this vintage likely presents aromas of caramel, vanilla, and oak, complemented by hints of dried fruits and subtle spices. The palate may offer flavors of honey, toasted nuts, and cinnamon, with undertones of leather and tobacco. The finish is expected to be smooth and lingering, with a pleasant warmth and notes of oak and sweet corn. Each bottle of Evan Williams Single Barrel Vintage is marked with the date it was put into oak, the bottling year, and the exact barrel number, allowing enthusiasts to trace the bourbon's journey from grain to glass. This attention to detail and transparency has made the Evan Williams Single Barrel Vintage series a favorite among bourbon connoisseurs and collectors alike.",

This 2022 bottling will have been crafted from Buffalo Trace's wheated bourbon mashbill and carefully blended by Julian and his son Preston Van Winkle.",

Known for its rich heritage and craftsmanship, Blanton's has become a sought-after favorite among bourbon enthusiasts.\n\nEach bottle of Blanton's comes from a single barrel, resulting in unique flavor profiles that can vary from one release to another. Typically bottled at 93 proof, this bourbon is aged in charred American white oak barrels, allowing it to develop a complex character over time. \n\nOn the nose, Blanton's Single Barrel offers inviting aromas of honey, caramel, and ripe fruit, complemented by hints of citrus and spice. The palate is full-bodied and vibrant, featuring flavors of cinnamon, vanilla, and dark chocolate. A subtle spiciness adds depth, while the finish is smooth and lingering, leaving behind notes of oak and sweet toffee.\n\nBlanton's iconic packaging includes a distinctive bottle shape and a horse-and-jockey stopper that has become a collector's item in its own right. With its combination of quality, rarity, and craftsmanship, Blanton's Single Barrel remains a benchmark for bourbon aficionados and continues to capture the hearts of whiskey lovers around the world.\n\n",

                "Description": "High West Distillery's \"A Midwinter Night's Dram\" is a highly anticipated annual limited release that has gained a cult following among whiskey enthusiasts. Launched in 2013, this unique expression is a blend of straight rye whiskeys finished in French oak port barrels.\n\nEach year's release is designated as a new \"Act,\" with the first release being Act 1 in 2013. Within each Act, there are multiple \"Scenes,\" representing different bottling runs. Despite initial speculation about variations between Scenes, High West maintains that the blending process ensures consistency across all bottlings within an Act.\n\nThe whiskey typically features a blend of rye whiskeys from various sources, including MGP's 95% rye, 5% barley malt mashbill and High West's own 80% rye, 20% malted rye distillate. The port barrel finishing imparts additional layers of complexity, with notes of dark fruits, baking spices, and subtle sweetness complementing the rye's inherent spiciness.\n\nA Midwinter Night's Dram is known for its rich, full-bodied character and is often described as reminiscent of holiday flavors. The brand recommends enjoying it neat, particularly during cold winter months. Each Act typically varies slightly in its flavor profile, alcohol content, and precise blend, making it an interesting subject for vertical tastings and yearly comparisons among whiskey aficionados.\n",
